a more stable way might be to write something at first after adb_signal_test_helper has installed signal handlers. And you can wait until you can read it using self.device.shell(cat).

what is the meaning of this comment? my understanding is: if you send SIGINT to adb client, the connect is closed on adb server and adbd, and local_socket_fd is closed on adbd. Then the adb_signal_test_helper gets SIGHUP. right? can we add some comment like this.
