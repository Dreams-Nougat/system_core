or just use a deque if you don't need contiguity?

(is this actually worthwhile at all? why are we so keen to avoid resizing?)

TBH no it's not important right now, since I don't think we have any commands that sends a lot of data from the device to the host. This just adds some future-proofing in case fastboot adds a command that does this later on.

As a comparison, when I implemented the device side in Python, the difference between keeping a list of buffers vs. appending to a single buffer as packets came in was enormous (<10 seconds vs several minutes for downloading a partition). I haven't actually tried in C++ though, so those numbers may not apply here.

In any case I'm happy to leave this out if you think it adds more complexity than it's worth and/or if there's no chance we're going to implement reading large amounts of data from a device.

why not a while loop? do we actually want to send an empty packet?

i guess so. comment on the do loops above, since do loops are unusual?

Will do, I was surprised myself to be finding a use for them.
