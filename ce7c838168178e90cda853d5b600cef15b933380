This is even a bit coarse, post-fs-system? Would require a rework of _all_ device rc files :-(

I did not test this, but I did look at the code and 'felt' (no flies on me) that putting a start logd here would not work; as service definitions did not appear to have a way to propagate this command to the service object?
