can we track this somewhere? so QA/test/android-boottime@ can chase folks down and get them to fix their stuff.

(i like this as a mitigation, but want a way to find and fix the bad code.)

With https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/314074 we have the data in the logs, and in the statistics. I could add additional statistics in 'logcat -b all -S' to highlight separately the top abusers that have had multiple lines suppressed/joined.

It has been three years I have been asking Q/A to capture the log statistics and take action on the data, without any traction.

ask again and cc: me and/or bdc. it's the fact that we're taking things like automated testing far more seriously than the old regime that means we found the motivating spam multiple ways in the same day: power, app install time, boot time, ...

anything that finds new problems faster or *pinpoints* them faster (because all the things found on monday were quite far from the real bug, until pattjin complained about log spam when *manually* testing) is important, and there's plenty of L8 support for anything that improves automated testing.

you might need to write the script to automate the "take action on the data" part though :-)
