i think this should probably be [ <flag> ]* [ <options> ] (i.e. missing the last * so we don't imply that options has to end with a trailing ',').

this is pretty confusing, though, because both the man page and /etc/fstab refer to both of these as options, and include them all in the same string. even init's mount_all command requires fstabs where they're all mixed together.

i'll raise a bug to rewrite 'mount' using 'mount_all'. then we can fix the documentation to just "mount <type> <device> <dir> [<options>]", and we can have a compatibility mode that concatenates anything after <dir>. (i'd rather just fix the init scripts, but i can only fix Nexus ones and i assume this would be a pain in the ass for OEMs because there's no way for me to communicate a breaking change.)

done wrt ,*.

man 2 mount calls these mountflags and data, not very clear either. the change just follows the comment prior int do_mount. maybe there should be a note on 'wait' here also.
