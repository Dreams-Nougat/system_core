The makefile doesn't include a shared version of libziparchive, and with static libraries don't differentiate between shared_libs and static_libs. So to behave the same as make:

  static_libs: ["libutils"],
  shared_libs: ["liblog", "libbase"],
  target: {
    android: {
      shared_libs: ["libz"],
    },
    host: {
      shared_libs: ["libz-host"],
    },
  },

This would be better if we could combine the libz and libz-host modules, and just change the shared library name with stem, but that wouldn't work with Make.

But this should work too -- we just may not share libz with other libraries in the process, or include libz-host.so when it isn't necessary.
