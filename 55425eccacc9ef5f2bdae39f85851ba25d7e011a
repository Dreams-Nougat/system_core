Shouldn't you check for truncation?

This is done by snprintf().

The idea is that the format_xxx functions use the same convention that snprintf() on Posix: always perform safe truncation (i.e. always append a final zero), but return the size of the full string anyway.

This allows you to call the function twice, the first time with buffer == NULL and buffer_len == 0, and the function returns the number of bytes you need for the output.

The second time, you call it with buffer != NULL, and buffer_len = required_size + 1, the extra 1 is required for the terminating zero (if you use required_size instead, the zero gets tucked at the end, erasing your last byte).

That's what the format_listeners code does.

We can't just return the value of snprintf() here directly because on Windows, the function is broken and will return -1 in case of truncation (yeah), and this code runs on the host.

If you prefer, I can use a different convention, but then I'll have to implement two functions: one to compute the size, and the other to do the write.

I'm not sure what you mean here, but just in case:

This string is generated in the ADB server daemon, and later passed to the client, which could be running on a different machine / OS.

For Windows, the conversion from \n to \r\n should be done in the client code. This actually happens through a simple printf(), which does that automatically on this platform (that's the reason why printf("Hello World\n") works correctly too).

Using \r\n when the daemon runs on Windows would create problems for Linux clients accessing the daemon through a SSH tunnel, for example.

Always generating \r\n is going to create problems for scripts and programs using the output of "adb forward --list" on non-Windows machines. That is, very unfortunately, a _very_ common complaint with "adb shell" that does just that for reasons that still elude me at the moment.

My bad. I thought that the snprintf() was going to convert \n like it handles LOCALE for some of the formats.

install_listener() can return -2 also and can be called with or without no_rebind.

   (!no_rebind && r < 0) ?

install_listener returns -2 when it can't actually bind() to the address, that's handled by the "else" portion here, i.e. it will print "cannot bind socket".

install_listener returns -1 when it cannot do one of the following:
- detects that there is an attempt to rebind the smart socket (independent of no_rebind).
- or detect that there is an attempt to rebind a normal socket with no_rebind == 1.

I thought that "cannot rebind socket" was generic and informative enough, but if you prefer, I can distinguish both cases (e.g. make the function return -3 or something). Let me know what you think.

The 2nd bullet reads as "rebind with no rebind".  If the user specifically asked for no rebind, then probably the reported error should not mention rebind either.

this is what converts the \n into \r\n on Windows.
