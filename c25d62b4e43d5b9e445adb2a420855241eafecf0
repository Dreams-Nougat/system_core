This makes adb commands always go through the One True Server if one exists locally, but I seem to recall that there are people spawning multiple adb servers, each using adb connect, for automated testing purposes or something along those lines. I'm not sure how we should balance that use case with the studio one, since they seem to want exactly opposite things. Maybe a switch that turns off the lockfile that also disables USB device handling?

Thoughts?

are there really people running multiple adb servers? are they only using TCP?

What is the behavior if you actually have multiple adb servers w/ adb connect? I thought your bug said that they all contend for USB and the behavior will be undefined?

I might be completely misremembering, but I think some of the internal testing stuff has TCP-only servers connected to emulators or something?

If there aren't any USB devices, I think it should work. If there are, when you plug in a devices, it'll get connected to one of the servers arbitrarily.
