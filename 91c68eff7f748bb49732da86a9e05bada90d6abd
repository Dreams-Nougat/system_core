Wouldn't it be better to define something like PTR_ZERO_PAD or ANDROID_LOG_PTR_ZERO_PAD and then let individual code use this definition rather than defining these two new inttype-like defines?

As Elliott mentions, I don't think there are that many places that would need to use this.

I'm not sure this it the right place for the definition, but I can't think of another place to put it.

You mean that you'd prefer each code to redefine a format using that PTR_ZERO_PAD?

>I don't think there are that many places that would need to use this.

Enough for it to be a recurrent issue, especially when you don't know if anyone is relying on the exact format and or alignment.

>I'm not sure this it the right place for the definition, but I can't think of another place to put it.

That was exactly my feeling :-).
