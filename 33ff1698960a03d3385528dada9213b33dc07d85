Make this static? I'm guessing you didn't kill the prev/next fields of fdevent because fdevent.h is also used by sysdeps_win32.cpp which still uses the fields?

What is fde.events for if fde.state already contains FDE_READ/WRITE/ERROR? Maybe there is some potential cleanup between fde.state and fde.events?

fde.state shows what the user wants in FDE_READ/WRITE/ERROR, fde.events shows the real events happened. They have different function. Am I misunderstanding your idea?

Ah, ok, makes sense. I guess my follow-up question then is: why doesn't this print out fde.events? But that might not be important, I don't know.

AFAIK, fde.events is not as useful as fde.state. fde.events is only valid when fde is on the pending_list. And fde is dumped mostly when there is some change to the fde, fde.state is more relevant. Of course we can print fde.events as well, but I also think it is not important.

done. unit test added. Although it is easy to check the error, we'd better leave it for poll() to handle it properly. For here, we may just report the error. Ignoring the error or abort() seem not proper.

I thought the point of using emplace() was to avoid unnecessary object construction/copying? Then don't you want to use emplace(fde->fd, fde)? Or do I misunderstand?

Here is not performance critical, I just wrote for convenience. emplace(fde->fd, fde) seems a little confusing as PollNode doesn't appear in it. By the way, I find it is suitable for error checking.

I think that LOG() from logging.h does not contain an 'if', so it will always run dump_fdevent() even if logging is not enabled. logging.h should probably be fixed (adding the if might fix the errno issue as well?).

Yes, this is a problem. logging.h has a default log level INFO, and the level can be adjusted by env ANDROID_LOG_TAGS. But there is no way to set environment for adbd. I think one solution is to set the log level according to trace setting. I prefer to do this in a separate CL. 
for the errno problem, I don't have any good idea to save errno in any situation while keeping current convenient logging style (I mean LOG() << xxx). But I am optimistic that we rarely meet the situation that errno should be saved while xxx in "LOG() << xxx" changes errno.

adb.cpp shows that there is a property persist.adb.trace_mask but that is for ADB_TRACE-style flags, not ANDROID_LOG_TAGS-style. Yeah, separate CL is fine.

Before I attempted the LOG() errno-saving, I looked for instances of code that depended on errno being preserved and there seemed to be at least a couple. (Of course, the good news is that most of the time errno is not overwritten.) I'll try to investigate this LOG()/errno issue next week (since I made the original errno restoring change), or you guys can feel free to beat me to it.

yeah, a copy & paste error. Firstly there was only one log below poll(), then I wanted to add another one to dump_pollfds().

I behave like this just because it is poll()'s behavior (unlike select()). But I think it doesn't matter, because now adb doesn't have any idea how to handle FDE_ERROR.

for FDE_ERROR, adb only print a debug message. The real error is handled when processing FDE_READ. So I think it doesn't matter to have FDE_ERROR or not in practice.

So this assumes that the caller will do a read? What if it only does a write? Or is that impossible?

strictly it is possible. But only when fdevent_install() the same fdevent for different fds. check is added here for that.

I don't think I understand how the CHECK_EQ(fde->fd, pollfd.fd) check checks whether the fde is already in the list?

suppose we have two fdevent_install() with the same fde but different fd.
fdevent_install(&fde, 1);
fdevent_install(&fde, 2);

fde.fd = 2
when some events happens on fd 1, it can be checked that fde.fd (2) != pollfd.fd (1).

I know this check is less clear than having a HashSet for used fdevents. But I think this error is unlikely to happen, and we don't need to spend much effort on it.

My understanding is that LOG(FATAL) calls abort() and that can make a coredump. I'm not sure if that makes sense for 'expected' runtime error conditions. In practice, I don't think it comes up because this stuff probably never fails (it isn't like adb is perfect with all memory allocs).

Yes, LOG(FATAL) causes abort(). I think failure is not acceptable here. I guess if here fails, the connection will never stop when you try to run commands like "adb shell ls".

Yes, failure is not acceptable, but do you really want a coredump (due to abort())? I don't know, I don't have a quick solution here, so maybe this is just something to think about in the future.
