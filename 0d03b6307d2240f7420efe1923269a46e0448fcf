never use sprintf. always use snprintf instead. didn't the compiler warn you about this?

here, though, you can use __android_log_buf_print, which is like printf, instead.

but any time you see something starting with __ you should probably assume "this isn't public API, and isn't what i'm supposed to be calling". the chain of macros in log.h is a bit of a mess, so i'll just tell you that the real public API is the ALOGI macro.
