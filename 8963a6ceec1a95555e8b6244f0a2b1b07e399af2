Might want to retain the fallback to /property_contexts if the selabel_open() fails on the /data/security/current/property_contexts so that we always have something loaded.

What is the proper way to deal with a complete set of policy files that exists under /data/security/current with matching selinux_version file yet the selabel_open fails for some reason on the override property_contexts file? We would have sepolicy, file_contexts using the override yet the property context using the base. That seems error prone. Is this where a reboot into a recovery mode would happen?

Are we sure we don't want to tuck this inside libselinux? It would make handling certain issues much easier across all policy files.
