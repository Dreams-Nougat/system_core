This is the only part I'm not sure of, I think this could leak local_socket_sfd_.

Before this change, when WaitForExit() wasn't properly called, our Subprocess object would retain ownership of local_socket_sfd_ and close it during destruction.

But now that WaitForExit() is closed, this code passes local_socket_sfd_ to fdevent_subproc_event_func() and assumes that it will close the FD, which I don't think it will since this FD never got registered with g_poll_node_map (fdevent.cpp:307).

I think we want to close this FD manually if ForkAndExec() failed, and check if it's valid before passing it here.

Yeah, I think you're right.

I'm wondering if it'd be cleaner to close the fd we read in fdevent_subproc_event_func in that case (also on line 312). Reading that function by itself makes me think that in those two error cases, it should either close the fd received or it should abort.

Thoughts?

Good call I think that makes the most sense.
