that's pretty bizarre syntax. seems like if we actually need optional labels, it would make more sense to allow '-' to mean auto-transition?

I find '-' a bit too cryptic.

In addition, it may not be an auto-transition at all? Could this also mean inherit context from init?

@nnk@ if we were to create a dummy-arg for SECLABEL, what would be intuitive to the selinux crowd?

What about _both_, this certainly would lighten the burden on the init-writer.

What about the word "default"?

  exec default logd log -- /system/bin/logcat -L ...

or "auto"? Or "-" like enh suggested. Any of those work for me.

I can't think of anything better.

I wouldn't have more than one choice though. Too many choices will make things confusing.

If we wanted to, we could make this a key/value pair:

exec seclabel=blah uid=blah gid=blah -- 

although that might be overkill too.

Another word choice: "sedefault", which gives a hint this is related to SELinux.

SELinux policy prohibits executing a binary from init without transitioning SELinux domains, so this is impossible. Either an explicit transition must be defined by policy, or seclabel needs to be used.

Do not be afraid of a little space, what about seclabel_default so it is abundantly clear (my bwain read yours as sed-e-fault for 250ms)? We could also print (whatever we choose) if seclabel == NULL; and in that case "-" scares me even more during logging prints and preference in that case is to let it print (null) if "-" it is.

I see 1.5 votes for "-", that is the current leader ;-}
