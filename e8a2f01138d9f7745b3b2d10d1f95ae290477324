is there a uevent that triggers this or are you just checking this en every uevent you receive?

selinux_status_updated() simply checks a sequence number in a read-only shared page mapped from the kernel by the  selinux_status_open() call to see if it has changed since the last call to selinux_status_updated().  So it is checking on every uevent but the check requires no system calls in the common case.  Implementation of selinux_status_updated() can be found in the corresponding change uploaded for external/libselinux with the same change-id since it is a dependency.
selinux_status_open()/selinux_status_updated() will fall back to checking a NETLINK_SELINUX socket on older kernels that do not support /sys/fs/selinux/status, but that would only be true for Linux < 2.6.37.

The question, though, is if you are guaranteed that a uevent is generated at the point when the reload is necessary, or will it be delayed until the next uevent?
