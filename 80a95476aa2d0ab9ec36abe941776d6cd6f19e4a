ART no longer seems to link against LLVM libraries or libbacktrace_offline.  Nonetheless, tested everything builds fine.

Because backtrace_test is not stripped, its size increases from 5M to ~50M.  Yabin, looks like you did that as a part of https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/171967/3/libbacktrace/Android.mk, where you did the shared-library approach.  Shall I remove this and strip symbols in backtrace_test?

I am not sure if stripping backtrace_test breaks test, I will test it today and reply.
