This toolbox change also looks ok to me, but it is not required from my perspective. I was under the impression that you guys wanted to keep the syntax for the command line tool the same as other existing implementations, i.e. name=value, and that is totally fine by me.

My only concern was the part in init, and that looks fine to me as well.
