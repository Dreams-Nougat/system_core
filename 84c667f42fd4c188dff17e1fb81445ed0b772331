You also need to update build/core/cleanbuild.mk, specifically the variable "installclean_files". Otherwise you could end up with userdebug/eng logd installed on a user build.

If we wanted to use a property, we should use ro.debuggable, instead of ro.build.type. ro.debuggable is true on userdebug/eng builds, and false on user builds.

However, as a general rule, I prefer compile time checks, to avoid the property space being subject to attack. We've had bugs in the past where it was possible to modify properties and convince the system it was a userdebug/eng build, when it was really a user build. A compile time check avoids these kinds of bugs.

logd is running _before_ /data is mounted. What are the implications if persist properties are not written? (device                   is stuck in a reboot loop, or randomly reboots and does not enter safe mode, either are bad).

You can add some redundancy in those that check these flags by also inspecting /sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops for the log message. Not to be trusted, but it takes you from 99% to 99.99%.

The reboot message can also be used as a means of communicating safe mode rather than depending on /data presence or integrity, it would show in the kernel command line as reboot reason?

It would be good to at least add a warning message to dmesg, even on userdebug/eng builds, to at least know this code is getting executed.

That is happening, the logToDmesg is such a warning. Or do you want it a WARNING level, as these are all at INFO level.

Please look at https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/201775, sounds like _that_ needs to be extended to support prwarn()?

line 141 is only reachable if AUDITD_ENFORCE_INTEGRITY is true, which is only on user builds. On userdebug / eng builds, this entire block is a no-op.

Specifically, I'd like to see this block replaced by something like:

if (loaded) {
  if (policyLoaded) {
    // Policy changes are not allowed. Reboot to safe mode to limit
    // damage.
    if (AUDITD_ENFORCE_INTEGRITY) { 
      enterSafeMode();
    } else {
      logToDmesg("Integrity Enforcement Suppressed - not rebooting to safe mode");
    }
  } else {
    logToDmesg("policy loaded; enforcing integrity");
    policyLoaded = true;
  }
}
