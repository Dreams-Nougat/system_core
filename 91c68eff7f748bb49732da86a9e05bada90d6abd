Wouldn't it be better to define something like PTR_ZERO_PAD or ANDROID_LOG_PTR_ZERO_PAD and then let individual code use this definition rather than defining these two new inttype-like defines?

As Elliott mentions, I don't think there are that many places that would need to use this.

I'm not sure this it the right place for the definition, but I can't think of another place to put it.
