does this build for the host? https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/100661/ claimed that the constants weren't in our prebuilt host gcc's headers.

I read https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/100661/, but at least what I saw in ch9.h looks OK and works as far as I can tell.
Maybe I am mistaken but "usb_linux.c" looks like it actually uses the linux kernel headers of your system directly ("linux/usb/ch9.h"). So if you have a recent kernel (with USB 3.0 support), you also get the right definitions from your kernel headers of your system, as far as I can tell.

I have abandoned https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/100661/. Picked this change and it works for me as well. I like this change better anyway. Can we please get this merged?

Also, I would like to propose a similar fix to fastboot/usb_linux.c as well. I can submit another change to Gerrit for that.
