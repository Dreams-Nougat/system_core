Please do not, ever, use the U+0060 character (it should not have been noncombining in the first place). Rationale: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/apostrophe.html

${HOSTNAME:=$(getprop ro.product.device)} is fine with me, though.

Removed space between $PWD and the $/#, to match ash and other common Linux distributions (Ubuntu bash).

I donâ€™t like this because this is pretty much a very quick indicator that mksh is indeed used (besides, older GNU/Linux distributions used to have the space there).

Also, it was not indicated in the commit message. Please leave the space there.
