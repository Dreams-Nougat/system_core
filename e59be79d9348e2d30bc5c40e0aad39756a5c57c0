do you have an example of such a constructor (to satisfy my curiosity)

This comment is very confusing. I think it refers to the fact that we keep mWeak>=mStrong and we have decremented only mStrong above, so mWeak cannot be 0.

just curious : why did you choose to have one thread that does NITERS/20 iterations instead of one racing thread per iteration ? In other words, why not move this std::thread construction & join inside the for loop ?
