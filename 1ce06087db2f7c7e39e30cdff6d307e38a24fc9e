i did look at removing the 3s sleep, but fdevent made it tricky --- it's easy to know that we've enumerated the USB devices and block returning the "OK" until then, and you get instantaneous adb startup ... but if your command was "adb devices -l" you'll see we haven't actually talked to all the devices yet, so they all come back as "unknown".

i'm not sure whether this is a regression or not. (because QA folks tell me that if you have enough devices connected, 3s isn't necessarily enough anyway. i have a bug about that somewhere, so i'm not excited about making that worse.)
