Hi Narayan, this line is not true anymore. Please remove it. For the above RTT, we may need to update after Robert's comments.

UMTS with 200ms RTT and 384kbps only needs 78643 max buffer to keep the channel saturated.  Even if we go with 500ms RTT as suggested by http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01509654 we only need 196608.  Lets cut this to 58254,349525,1048576

hspa is highly asymmetric.

Can't find my old reference for the 40ms RTT. Just search again, 50ms RTT seems to be the reasonable average. Is it ok to use your suggested number for hsupa here?

I suspect your 25ms RTT time is low for this network.  It was advertised as sub 50ms latency (one way).  Lets use 110683,664098,1992294

Hi Robert, what is your calculation base for this number, so we can update the commit message accordingly. Besides, more networks support HSPA+ CAT20 (42Mbps). If using sub 50ms latency, we probably can use the lte window size here.

100ms RTT and 19Mbps.  Does that match your expectation?

If it truly is 100ms and 42Mbps, it needs huge buffers.  I find it hard to believe though that they would approach .5 the speed of LTE but have 5x the latency.  Do you suppose the 50ms latency comments actually meant 50ms RTT?  If so we'd need buffers roughly 2x the size of LTE.

My assumption is 42Mbps and 50ms RTT. So the size is:
122334,734003,2202010

Then maybe just use the buffer size for LTE, not to exceed it. We can still use the number is your previous comment which is reasonable as well.

My goal is to make sure to pass the lab test with the default values and they should work fairly well on real networks (lower speed & longer RTT). Thanks.

Is there an advantage to "use the buffer size for LTE"?  Why not use the numbers calculated for this network type?  I'm ok with your 122334,734003,2202010.  The upload rate is limited to 11Mbps I think, yielding 32040,192239,576717,122334,734003,2202010

Ok, will update accordingly. Thanks.
