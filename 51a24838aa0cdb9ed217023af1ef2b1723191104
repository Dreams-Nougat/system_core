the .arm suffix is very important to generate more speedy code on ARM, removing it here is likely to affect performance in a negative way. Please ensure it is kept when targetting ARM.

Does keeping the suffix affect x86 compilation? I thought it did not. If not, just leave it there. Otherwise, use ifdef .. else .. endif somewhere.

I would prefer that this was added only when building for x86. At a minimum, make it explicit with a comment.

same here, this includes should only be added when targetting x86.

I'd recommend renaming GGLAssembler.h to GGLArmAssembler.h, and putting in GGLAssembler.h all the #if defined(...) .. #elif defined(...) #else .. #endif logic.

Please let's keep things consistent and rename this to ANDROID_X86_CODEGEN

That's a *really* ugly dependency that is bound to break at some point in the future. We probably need an external/libenc first instead to de-couple the library from the runtime code before it is used here. Elliot, what do you think about this?

the whole of dalvik/vm was removed at least a year ago...
