this seems like a lot of work to go to just to write a test that will always fail.

why not just 

  #if defined(__ANDROID__)
  #endif

around the whole body of this test instead? it's meaningless on the host anyway.

(if you look at the bionic tests, we sometimes have an explicit log statement in a #else explaining why the test is meaningless in the #else case, but that's not necessary.)

Actually, this test _should_ succeed on the host (untested). It is perhaps meaningless on windows host, but not Mac or Linux host. I revel in additional testing/hardening/coverage for libcutils pieces.

what you've written will fail on the mac because toggle_O_NONBLOCK always returns failure on the Mac.

you've also broken Linux because you're setting SOCK_NONBLOCK and then unsetting it on the next line.

and if you are still going to do this, let's not copy & paste toggle_O_NONBLOCK...
