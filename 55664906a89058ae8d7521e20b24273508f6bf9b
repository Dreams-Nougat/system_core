al: any chance you could help us out with this? my assumption is that we can kill the loop in InitUSB in usb_osx.c and just call the body once, after removing the CFDictionarySetValue that filters on kUSBVendorID.

i'm assuming that just filtering on ADB_SUBCLASS and ADB_PROTOCOL should be sufficient. (note that the Linux code filters on ADB_CLASS too. not sure if it's deliberate that the Mac code doesn't? seems like a bug.)
