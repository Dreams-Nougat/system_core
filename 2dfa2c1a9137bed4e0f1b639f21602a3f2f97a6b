why wouldn't you just return NULL?

I choose so to be pedantic about directly calling pthread_exit to be explicit about the paths.

pthread_cleanup_push() (and, if memory serves, other historically similar entities) is not what you think it is (I know you know what it is ;->). It is a (sometimes) dysfunctional block context to pthread_cleanup_pop and is required. However, historically there is a difference in thread locking when processing the cleanup operations within the context of pthread_exit and when pthread_cleanup_pop is called out in the thread just before exit. The alternative is:

    pthread_cleanup_pop();
    return NULL;

Which has a difference in atomicity because the thread is still 'alive' until return NULL, but the thread is 'dead' while the cleanup is being called in pthread_exit. Since then I have preferred:

    pthread_exit(NULL);
    pthread_cleanup_pop();
    return NULL;

I was bitten by this (circa 2002, port to *all* UNIXii) difference and I am still smarting over it.

I know, this is a decade later, and Linux _or_ Bionic is our target. If you are confident I am holding on to too much history, I'll relax ...

no, you couldn't write

    pthread_cleanup_pop(true);
    return NULL;

because, as you say, the pop is really a "} while".

you'd just return NULL here (which is equivalent to calling pthread_exit(NULL) but less weird), and then you'd

    pthread_cleanup_pop(true);
    return NULL;

at the end (i.e. just remove the pthread_exit and the NOTREACH).

that's exactly the same because the return NULL is equivalent to pthread_exit(NULL), and the first thing that pthread_exit does is call your cleanup functions.

likewise.
