see comment below about how patch still leaves device in charger mode

so far as I understand, this would be a bug in the kernel driver?  It looks like the main point of the patch is to handle not-charging states such as charging thermal shutdown etc.?

yes, to handle cases where charger is connected and not-charging. There is no point in remaining in charger-mode if we're not charging.

the patch still leaves the device in charger mode, but stops the animation (and has some other side effects for which I've raised questions).  Is the intent to power off when in not-charging state?

is there a reason to not request suspend if not charging?  The point of this check is to avoid suspending if no charger connected, since we plan to shutdown soon.  If a charger is connected but in not-charging state then might as well suspend?

In handle_power_supply_state, we want to shutdown if a charger is connected but is not-charging.
Hence, we don't want to suspend in this case.

this change doesn't seem necessary: if no chargers are online then device should not be charging.  In any case if no charger connected then should shutdown.

This is to make the behavior consistent with the Android service in which on any uevent, all of the power_supplies are parsed through.
In charger-mode, if an uevent from 'Battery' power-supply is seen, 'online' property of other power-supplies are not updated.  
Hence, we need this to ensure we don't remain in charger-mode without charging, if for some reason the online update/uevent is missed.
