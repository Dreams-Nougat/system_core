you probably need to include some information about what generated this and how to regenerate it. could we just have that in the script rather than check in the generated file?

I generated this file by running ./external/chromium-trace/systrace.py and manually extracting the header before where the trace data goes.

My vision for where boot systracing should go is to add a -boot argument to systrace.py that reboots the device and gathers the trace for you, in which case boot_trace_header.html and grab-boottrace.sh would not be needed.
