'no ID_DONE' is a pretty useless error message, especially when it happens because of EOF, resulting in the message 'failed to copy foo to bar: no ID_DONE: Success'. I don't think any other errors are plausible, since the fd is actually an internal socketpair.

Maybe 'disconnected from device' would be better?
