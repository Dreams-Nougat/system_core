I would have found this easier to read with a comment that it's really a dev_t, and is always either zero or the ashmem dev_t.

I don't see why this really requires any ordering.  There is no other state you expect to be consistent as a a result of seeing a nonzero value.  I would use either memory_order_relaxed consistently (if the cost of a couple of fences matters), or a plain atomic_store (if it doesn't matter, and you want to keep the code as simple as possible).

Consume is currently pretty broken.  And it's not what you want here anyway.  Again, I think relaxed is fine here and above.
