There's no such thing as a cygwin build, so this can go away as well.

only 9 files in the tree reference it so that should be easily killable.

and if trevordrake is looking for random makefile cleanup :-) ... TARGET_SIMULATOR has been obsolete for about 4 years at this point. although i suspect most remaining references to that are in proprietary vendor device drivers at this point.

Ahh well I'll see your TARGET_SIMULATOR and raise you a BOARD_USES_GENERIC_AUDIO :) which does nothing as where it was used is commented out it seems. Seeing as random makefile cleanup seems to be my current calling I shall no doubt take a look. We're also only a couple of commits away from killing libunz too.
