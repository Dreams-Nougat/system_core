where did 45s come from? what does a kasan kernel actually need?

45s is an arbitrary amount of time that was decided to be the ultimate threshold that we could accept and consider as a considerably long period of time.

There is no answer to your second question, unfortunately, because for different devices, it seemed to be very different. And we really don't know say, for a future device and a different kernel version, is the time needed going to be longer or shorter than the one that is currently deployed.

do you have current real-world numbers for specific devices? for things like this it's good to leave a comment that has specifics.

(right now it's not obvious whether 45s is 1x your worst device's kasan time or 2x or 10x...)

Currently, for marlin, measured for one particular boot, it's 5.04889. So, I estimate that the magnitude of 45s should be about 9-10x worst device's current kasan time.
