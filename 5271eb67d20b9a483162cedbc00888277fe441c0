This work, alternately it may be simpler to take this * out and just pass a regular list since I think we're never actually calling this function with an unpacked list (the call sites would then take * out as well).

I think using * here and in the call sites just causes Python to unpack the list at the call site, then pack it back up again right away for the function.

Thanks. I took out the * here and at the call-sites and tested it and it seems to work as expected. Basically, I wanted to make sure that if there were positional args passed in the future, that I'd transparently pass them down. I made a minimal test case and I think it works.
