Change to accept a string address.  No need for a v4 and a v6 interface.  Actually all the in_addr_t params in the header should change to const char *.

don't add a new function for this.

Can you add a comment explaining why this needs to be 1?

Is it possible to use AF_INET instead of IPv4 and AF_INET6 instead of IPv6 here?

What happens if the conversion from string to in6_addr fails? The function returns void, so there's no indication of error to the caller (since inet_pton does not touch its output value unless it succeeds).

This function should probably return an integer (e.g. 0 on success, -1 on failure).

Looking at the inet_pton man page and the bionic/libc source code suggests that inet_pton returns 1 on success, 0 if the address is invalid, and -1 if the address family is invalid. Since this case cannot happen (AF_INET6 is a valid address family), just simplify the code to if (ret <=0) { printerr("inet_pton() failed: invalid address %s\n"); }

As per comments to the .h file, can you rename this to add_ipv6_route, make it take an "int prefixlen" parameter, and use that instead of IPv6_ADDR_LEN? You probably don't need to check that the 0 <= length <= 128, I expect the kernel will do that for you (but please make sure it does).

If there is no IPv6 support in the kernel, this will fail. In that case, can you set errno to EAFNOSUPPORT? Something like this would probably work:

if (ifc_ctl_sock6 < 0) {
  errno = EAFNOSUPPORT;
  return -1;
}

(Otherwise errno will end up being set to EBADF, which is not going to help debugging.)

This will change errno if it fails. Perhaps you can assign errno to a temporary variable before calling ifc_close6()?

inet_aton only returns 0 or 1. You can remove this case.

This code duplicates what you have above. Can you factor it out into a common add_ipv6_route method that takes ifindex, flags, and ipv6_addr as a parameter? That method could decide whether to populate rtmsg_gateway or rtmsg_dst based on whether flags has the RTF_GATEWAY bit or not.

Or better, even collapse it in with the v4 versions too.

Can you rename addr_type to family?
