This is wrong, you should never call __system_property_set directly.  Use property_set.

I'm not sure if setting properties from ueventd is even supported - ueventd is forked as a separate process to avoid deadlocks with the init process, but property_set requires a blocking RPC to init to modify the shared property area.  This might cause deadlocks if a verity event arrives while init is waiting for ueventd to process a module load firmware event.
