why isn't it using liblog?

Logging happens inside of a signal handler, and liblog doesn't seem to be async signal safe. ("Do not use LOG in a signal handler.")

You removed this comment:

// NOTE: Any changes to this structure must also be reflected in
//       bionic/linker/debugger.cpp.

Given that comment, maybe it would be better to move this to a header file exported by the linker itself, then to always have two copies.

re: typedefs in this file --- do we have any C clients left, or can we make this C++-only?

(replying to the comment on the other CL here for convenience)

I'm not very attached to the location of the library, but this way seemed cleaner to me since it keeps the client and server in the same repo.

AFAIK, just cutils. I held off on moving that into libdebuggerd_client until I knew for sure that it'd be going here instead of the linker.

The reason I thought it might be better in linker is that it reduces the number of external dependencies that bionic has. However, since debuggerd and the linker are so intertwined, it might not make a difference.

yeah, and it seems like we'd be more likely to change the debuggerd side of things than the libc interface, so having the library here in debuggerd should make any future changes easier. (and moving the libcutils API into here in a future change sounds like a good cleanup, whereas moving that into the linker... ugh!)

we might want to put a version number in the debugger_msg_t though...

seems like this stuff should be in a libdebuggerd_client library rather than cutils?
