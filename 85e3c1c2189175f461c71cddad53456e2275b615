Needed for FRIEND_TEST() macro to allow tests to muck with some protected class members.

the reason that having cutils_socket_buffer_t just be a typedef (to two different types) seemed reasonable was because it avoided any translation. if our only known user is going to have to do that anyway, should SendBuffer move to libcutils as cutils_socket_buffer_t, and the translation happen there?

Yeah that probably makes sense, I didn't realize initially I was going to have to do so much additional work here.

I'll rework this a bit as you suggest, should simplify it.

what if you fail with ECONNRESET? this doesn't seem right. other than EINTR (which is already handled by TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY), why would you try again?

I think this does what you're suggesting already unless I'm misunderstanding you - if this iteration returns -1, we break the loop and return the total number of bytes sent so far.

The special case is just saying if we never completed a send at all, return -1 instead of 0. I'll look into reworking the code to make this a little more obvious.

oh, duh. misread. which perhaps just proves that the special case is confusing :-)

is it useful? if your success/failure test is actually "does the return value equal the total size of the vector?", how does -1 help callers? (and doesn't that mean that success/failure is actually hard to test for because you need to iterate your vector/carry additional metadata. another argument in favor of a bool return?)

returning -1 or total is misleading too. do you really just want a boolean here, since you seem to be assuming that the only thing to do on failure is give up anyway (since you return -1 rather than what, if anything, was actually transferred)?

Boolean probably makes sense here as well, but current behavior does return the total number of bytes transferred up until the failure.

Just to avoid putting it in the global namespace.
