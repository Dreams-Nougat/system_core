is there a uevent that triggers this or are you just checking this en every uevent you receive?

selinux_status_updated() simply checks a sequence number in a read-only shared page mapped from the kernel by the  selinux_status_open() call to see if it has changed since the last call to selinux_status_updated().  So it is checking on every uevent but the check requires no system calls in the common case.  Implementation of selinux_status_updated() can be found in the corresponding change uploaded for external/libselinux with the same change-id since it is a dependency.
selinux_status_open()/selinux_status_updated() will fall back to checking a NETLINK_SELINUX socket on older kernels that do not support /sys/fs/selinux/status, but that would only be true for Linux < 2.6.37.

The question, though, is if you are guaranteed that a uevent is generated at the point when the reload is necessary, or will it be delayed until the next uevent?

ueventd doesn't need to process the reload immediately; it only needs to ensure that it reloads its configuration before it next looks up an entry in it (i.e. selabel_lookup) to label a device node.  There is no uevent generated by the reload, so the handling is delayed until the next uevent, but this should be harmless.  The alternative approach would be to add a descriptor to a NETLINK_SELINUX socket, which does get a notification upon reload, to the poll()'d set in ueventd and handle it there.
