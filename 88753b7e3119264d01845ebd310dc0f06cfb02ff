Reviewer: decide if I could be allowed to leave this alone?

This apparent inefficiency is reserved for initializations that need to be done first time, as well as on re-init.

I know this could be:

 while (reinit_running && !sem_wait(&reinit) && reinit_running) {

but it will be rewritten to this form with intervening code when we get the statistics fixed for b/19608965 which is blocked behind this adjustment.
