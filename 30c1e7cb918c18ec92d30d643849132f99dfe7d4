Any reason to not make this all or nothing? All we're aiming to do here is make it so we don't break NDK code that already compiles. If they want to opt in to new features, they can opt in to all of them.

Because some use ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL (some stuff in-tree BTW) and some use __ANDROID_API__, where the later is ours I believe, and the other is used sporadically.

Where do you see ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL? I see it only in cmake files in external: https://cs.corp.google.com/search/?q=ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL&m=100&sq=package:android&type=cs

ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL means nothing to the NDK right now.

This is new ABI. Do you really want to expose this? Would an app ever need this? The only caller in the entire tree is the Zygote forking function.

Double underscore functions exposed to the NDK, but not recommended to be called directly; so there is a point to not include this.

However, I kept it here because it represents completeness, a partner's code caller should have the power to close logging after a fork, and before an exec (the FDs are CLOEXEC so it is a weak argument) or before they continue on the process (the stronger argument).

If it gets exposed in the NDK it can *never* change. The ABI and the behavior needs to remain consistent forever.

Don't expose anything for completeness. Expose things because they are useful to apps.

Do you feel a comment is warranted is why you said this, or is this just a delineation of sorts?

I should move CLOSE interface down here too ...

My point is that anything below this point is something you're committing to maintain the ABI and behavior of forever. Not thinking about what libc APIs to expose is a mistake that was made nearly a decade ago that we're still paying for. If there's anything in here that isn't useful for an app, don't expose it.

False, if the caller does not define __ANDROID_API__ or ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL. I found that in most builds, this is the cased (undefined).

Whoops. Yes, you're right. That goes to prove my point that ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL is confusing when we already have __ANDROID_API__ though. __ANDROID_API__ is always defined, ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL isn't, despite the fact that they have more or less the same name and seem to represent the same concept.

As I said before, we shouldn't be gating any of these things based on target API level (especially not a fake target API level, this is only going to further confuse and already confusing topic for NDK development).

We are going to need to talk about this. This might not be the right forum to educate me ...

Are you talking universally, or just for the MACROs?

I do not want to define any interfaces here that will not work if targeted for JB for example, and generally this gives a strong layer of lint checking to their builds.

For the case of the MACROs, we are special and also switch this all on if LOG_TAG defined which is a substantive bypass, the gate on API Version is to make sure we do not fail in external builds that count on the legacy variant of android/log.h.

Yes, just the macros. ABI should be gated by the version that it's available in.

ANDROID_USE_LOG_MACROS (or ANDROID_HIDE_LOG_MACROS, if we prefer on by default, either works for me) would make this a lot more clear. It isn't obvious that LOG_TAG would change the interface provided here. Also remember that the reason this came up in the first place is that some external code was using LOG_TAG to mean something different.

Because we would like to allow radio components to be able to built out-of-tree. I had the BRCM folks complain about this.

Is the radio log really the only thing blocking that? Most vendor code depends on a ton of things that aren't available in the NDK.
