Using this flag to detect if |s| is the console service is a bit weird: This flag actually means "console required" but seems to only be used by console.

Should we create a new service attribute (unterminable ? ignores_sigterm?) set for services that ignore the SIGTERM signal so that we don't have to wait for them?

Maybe make this a constant? kTerminateServiceDelayMicroSeconds or something.

I don't think it can. This not accessed concurrently and RemoveService can handle |svc| not being in the list of services.

Should this have a way of erroring out in case ReapOneProcess constantly returns true?

I guess you're calling waitpid with WNOHANG and returning false in that case, you cannot always get and kill a process and never end... unless the system is in the middle of something like a fork bomb? I guess maybe in that case we don't care what happens.

There might be pathological cases where this will run forever but I don't think there is a good way to handle it. We could set a limit on the number of process we can Reap in one go (1000?) but I'm not sure what the consequences would be in the rest of the system. In doubt, it might be better to keep this simple.

A service crash loop will not cause this as we will first reap all stopped services before starting them again.

Hmmm... I wonder if this is going to cause a problem if a third party process tries spinning up lots of processes, and prevents the user from rebooting...

Given that the status quo is killing everything with SIGKILL, a solution that only calls waitpid kNotSoBigNumber times and then does SIGKILL still seems like a marked improvement to the current state, and doesn't include a seemingly infinite loop.
