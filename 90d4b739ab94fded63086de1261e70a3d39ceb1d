argh. i'd missed this subtlety. this really does mean "adb server", not "adbd". i'm not convinced that's actually useful because most of the time it should match your adb client. i can't see a [reasonable] way to plumb the atransport* through to file_sync_client.cpp, so i'll have a look at changing this so we can see the adbd features. (please upload your change if you've already fixed this!)
