where did we require/guarantee that |id| and |product| and |exec_name| do not have ' or trailing \ in them ?  we should add a json check func to sanitize & log an error when they're bad.

i don't mean try and blacklist certain behavior like looking for a ' in the middle or a \ at the end -- you get into pathological cases like foo\'bar (which is valid) and bar\\\\ (which is valid).  let's whitelist values with a regex like [[:alnum:]_].  exec_name prob needs to allow through a bit more, but you get the idea.
