we called it __LIBC_HIDDEN__ because we are libc. you might want to choose a different name.

(better still, you should switch to -fvisibility=hidden and explicitly *export* public functions. we eventually did that [and could actually remove all the __LIBC_HIDDEN__s at this point, and will probably do so at some point].)

<sigh> and to export, one uses __LIBC_ABI_PUBLIC__ from <sys/cdefs.h>.

I will split this CL into two, the first will add explicit exports. What makes me sad and holds me back is that I see some history in sys/cdefs.h regarding 'binary compatibility for LP32' ... why was that introduced?

well, that's no-op private implementation cruft that we're also going to remove. (the right way to do things when you have a huge API surface like the C library is using linker maps, not annotations in header files.)

Unit test was manual, rebuild with this mispelled. We can not compose a gTest for this feature, and even if we could add a lever into this code to manipulate it for testing, we would require an intervening reboot to see the results.
