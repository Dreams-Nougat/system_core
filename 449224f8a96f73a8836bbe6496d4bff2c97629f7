I don't have a better suggestion but "Early" is a bit fuzzy for me. 

Maybe "PreInitialize...."?

If the env values are exposed as a symbol in native bridge, this interface will be removed.

Hmm, doesn't this depends on the isa? I might be wrong but as it is now the design allows for more than one system to be emulated, and that could depend on the original isa.

The cpuinfo_path should be involved here, as well. All of these values can be fetched from native bridge library by dlsym in LoadNativeBridge. And the EarlyInitializeNativeBridge can bind-mount the /proc/cpuinfo based-on this cpuinfo_path without invoking any interface of native bridge with privileged permission.

I think we should use supported_abis. cpu_abi and cpu_abi are already deprecated: frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Build.java

We also need to dlsym the symbol of runtime values here.

I'd feel slightly better to introduce a new state. Would make things a bit easier to debug probably.
Either way, I favor early returns than surrounding all the function code in an if.

can assume this will always be null terminated?

this is a bit of magic :). Would benefit of a rationale comment.

We'd better retrieve the cpuinfo file path in LoadNativeBridge by dlsym the fixed symbol in native bridge library directly. Otherwise, we have to generate a cpuinfo file per process.

I'm a bit confused by the expectation here. This implies that the cpuinfo file is already there. Given that the private dir is per_app/per_user how does it gets there? who creates it?

I think it worth adding the full path, i.e. the 'buffer'. Which now I thing it should be rename to cpuinfoPath or something.

don't really care, but 4 should be enough, right?

even if it's small I'd extract this in a local function to avoid duplication
