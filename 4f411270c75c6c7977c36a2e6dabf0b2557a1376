As mentioned, this could be static. Then it's easier in the caller, just FuseBridgeLoop::Start...

Sorry for missing the fix. According to Google C++ style guide, a global function is preferred to a class containing only static members.
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Nonmember,_Static_Member,_and_Global_Functions

So I turned this and FuseAppLoop::Start into global functions. For FuseBridgeLoop, I could not delete the class in this patch because the class is used in the framework code. I'll delete the class after I changed the framework code so that it uses the new global function.

Thank you!

If you're going with Google C++ style, then you should also heed the other advice and not pollute namespaces. How about adding a nested "fuse" namespace?
