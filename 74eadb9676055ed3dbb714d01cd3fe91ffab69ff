really? that seems retarded. can't you fix that?

the uapi mips stat.h has "unsigned long st_mtime". are you sure the real problem here isn't that bionic's stat.h has the wrong definition for mips64's struct stat?

The uapi mips stat.h under _MIPS_SIM_ABI64 has unsigned int (32-bit) st_mtime.

can't you fix that? surely you don't want to go backwards with your new architecture?

(and surely the last thing mips needs is _new_ source-level incompatibilities with everyone else?)

We are looking into possible solutions to have a better fix. Modifying the stat structure is not a possibility as it would break existing MIPS64 binaries but may be another definition of the structure could be created for Android.

what existing mips64 binaries? and didn't you make instruction set changes that cause breakage already anyway?

if the worst comes to the worst and you can't/won't fix the kernel, we should go the glibc route and have a sane struct stat in the c library and translate to/from it on all calls. we can't go round all our own tree hacking every struct stat user, let alone go around all third-party code.

but you really ought to look at making a sane modern kernel for your new architecture. this seems like your one chance to fix the errno mess and the signal mess and so on...

The instruction set changed but we are still using N64 ABI. Agree with you that changing the entire source might be difficult. I will look into what can be done.
