this means that any calling code that uses this needs to be built with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 too. i guess the fact that it's all C++ means we're safe because the mangled names won't match if you screw up?

i think this style is a mistake for a public API. it made sense for code that was only used in FUSE, but it's already led to bugs in art (where people use TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY). just switch to true/false instead?
