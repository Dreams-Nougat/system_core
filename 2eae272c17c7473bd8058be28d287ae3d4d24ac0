What happens in this case? It seems like we are saying:

 - if possible use /tmp/adb.log
 - if that isn't possible, redirect to /dev/null
 - if that isn't possible, then ?

Seems like it should be fatal, but it looks like this will never happen since the previous version doesn't even check for that error..

Yes that's what the change is saying. If we make that last case fatal, why not make the first case fatal too? That's my overall design question for you guys. I'm somewhat ambivlent. I think I modeled this after start_device_log() that just continues on if there is an error. But really I'm open to ideas. My gut just says to make everything during startup fatal, but I'm open to ideas...

Personally, I'd prefer fatal, but enh/danalbert would know better.
