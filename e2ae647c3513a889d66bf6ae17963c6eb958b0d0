I made a function to create this type, it seems more flexible and less error-prone than a macro but still works as initialization. Since the structs are small copying them around shouldn't be a problem.

But if you'd prefer the macro approach (or avoiding this type altogether and just passing void*[], size_t[] into the function) LMK and I can change it.
