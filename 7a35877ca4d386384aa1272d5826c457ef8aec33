It would be a bit more code, but maybe we want to query this through JNI and not use a constant? Else we need tests, and nobody ever runs tests... :-(

There are two problems that I see, though:

1) We might have to wait till all of the framework is available in AOSP, not sure...
2) The ART test doesn't have access to the framework, I think, so we'd have to create a minimal class there.

I though about it but it's not doable (i.e. to call into framework) because we need the context which is not available here.

Even with reflection we would still need tests. I was planning to add them after we have agreed that we want this.

I think it's fine to hard-code.

hmm, doesn't len already have the +1 for \0 built in above?
