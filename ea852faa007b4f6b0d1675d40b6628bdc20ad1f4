considering how much debate these CLs have garnered, should add a new paragraph here like:

 // Note: This will mean that the dbus-send process will become a zombie and
 // reparent to init for reaping, but that's OK -- see above.

not a new issue, but should this be plog ?  and maybe say:

 ... << "Sending user crash dbus signal failed";

I can change it to plog.  It just seemed a bit redundant, as all cases where chromeos::ProcessImpl::Start() returns false, it already PLOGs the errno, and this warning message is mostly just to clarify what called the Start().
