I think the reason D() used a lock was because there used to be two calls to fprintf(), but enh changed that recently. Base logging uses a lock around the logger.

I was going to suggest removing the errno saving/restoring because I do that in LOG(), but I just tested it and I didn't do it correctly (damn, I should have written a test for it).
