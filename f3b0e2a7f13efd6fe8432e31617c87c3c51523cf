nit: raw ShellProtocol* might be preferable here, doesn't really matter to me I just remembered the C++ primer saying something about this.

(from C++ primer: "In general, if you find yourself wanting to use a pointer or reference to a unique_ptr, you're probably not transferring ownership, so you should usually just pass a pointer or reference to the underlying object, and keep unique_ptr out of it.")

Is it safe to do this in a signal handler? I can't seem to find concrete information in the man pages but the articles/forum posts that I can find indicate this is unsafe.

Would it be feasible to drop the lock and instead only enable SIGWINCH handling after the read thread has been set up?

Why not just set a volatile sig_atomic_t flag here and read it when read() returns EINTR? As well as David's idea.

because read won't return EINTR unless i send the SIGUSR1. the SIGWINCH goes to the main thread (strictly, an arbitrary thread not of our choosing) so this signal handler exists merely to ensure that _some_ signal gets sent to the stdin read thread, which will cause the read to fail with EINTR.

If you do David's suggestion, can you kill the mutex & check of stdin_read_thread?

there's no good way in our current code to implement the "after" part. (this lock is my implementation of the "after" part. it's how we know that the other thread got far enough for us to safely start sending it signals.) i think the real fix is to not have two threads, but that's a big enough change we should do it separately.

I may be misunderstanding the problem here, but according to signal(7), signals will be delivered to an arbitrary thread selected from those which do not block the signal.

Can we just block SIGWINCH before spawning the thread, and then use pthread_sigmask() to unblock it only for this thread, guaranteeing that it's delivered to only this thread? Then we can avoid the SIGUSR1 secondary signal altogether.

as an aside: now we're always building for Windows too, i wonder if we should just get rid of these #defines for Unix? (but keep them for Windows.) that way Unix-only code doesn't need to do stuff like this, but we'll still know straight away if we've tried to use bare 'read' in code that runs on Windows.

Makes sense to me, enabling a 3rd read() function is kind of a bummer but it seems necessary, and better than having to mess with macros for a legitimate use case like this.

It's up to you guys. I guess there's two main schools of thought:

- Make read() on Windows work with C Runtime fds and sysdeps fds.
- Split read() into unix_read() which works with C Runtime fds and adb_read() which works with sysdeps fds.

So the proposal is for a 3rd option?

a 4th option would be "remove the TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY from unix_read on Unix, and explicitly write TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY in all but one call site". (which is the real problem that brought me here, not so much the fact that we have two different reads.)

i wasn't planning on doing anything about this right now, just throwing out another idea.

4th option sounds ok if you generally want to keep the codebase unix-ish (which is fine).

there are very few uses of unix_read, and most of them are in non-Windows code. this and copy_to_file are the only exceptions. if we ripped out the STDIN_FILENO support from copy_to_file (and just asserted that we're _not_ dealing with stdin, which we currently never are), we'd really just have this call site, and it really just wants _console_read.

but i don't have a particularly strong opinion. things aren't too bad right now, and mostly work.

i'll copy the #define read ___xxx_read here for now, to preserve the status quo.

(i'd like to move all this code out into a separate file, but i've been disruptive enough here already.)
