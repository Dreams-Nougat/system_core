maybe this should be called in_emulator instead of qemu

We could do that, but it would require making the same change over in external/sepolicy where the boolean is defined.  Up to you.

why are somethings doing a restorecon and some aren't? Maybe we should be doing a context restore on all the things we chown? Can chown be modified to do a context restore or would that be odd? I'm just trying to minimize the errors when others change their rc files and arbitrarily sprinkle the files with restorecons until things work.

scratch that, making chown do it would be sucky and ugly.

Is there a way we can just do a "restorecon_all" at the end of the init process (before remounting root ro, and then after setting up /data) to just restore the context of everything?

Most of the directories are created with the right context during build (the already merged mkyaffs2image and make_ext4fs changes) or by init when it creates the directory (pending change If6af6c4887).  So we only need restorecon calls now for a few cases.  /dev and /dev/socket are created by init before policy is first loaded, so we have to restorecon them afterward.  /cache needs to be initially labeled after filesystem creation there, so we do it here much the same way as chown/chmod is applied.  /data generally shouldn't be required as the initially flashed image will be labeled already but is done here just in case it was reset, again similar to the chown/chmod situation.  Not sure what a restorecon_all would do or where it would obtain its list of directories to apply; we don't really need or want to restorecon the entire directory tree on each boot and that would be slow.

One other observation: the restorecon calls need to happen as early as possible so that any files subsequently created in those directories will be labeled correctly.  So the restorecon /dev /dev/socket has to happen before ueventd starts, and the restorecon /cache and /data should occur before anything else gets created in them.
