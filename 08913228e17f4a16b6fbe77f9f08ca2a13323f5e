@nnk, aside from binaries in sbin (with no good label) it might make sense to explicitly set security context if you invoke some utility like /system/bin/rmdir this way. but for cases where there is a natural label on the invoked binary the security context should be derived from that, right?
since this is the first exec user in the public tree it would be good to have a pattern that others should follow.
