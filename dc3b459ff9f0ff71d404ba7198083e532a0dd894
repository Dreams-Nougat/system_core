Is there a reason this is a fatal and not returning nullptr?

this one i didn't actually change. i just replaced 0 with nullptr. :-)

but to answer the general question... given that the other call sites didn't check before, i don't want to surprise their callers by pushing null check responsibility up to them. especially for these fixed-size allocations: if you can't allocate a fixed-fixed struct, you're about to die anyway.

for the ones that already had some error handling, i copied what they'd done. i'm not sure that was a good idea.

I suspected this was the answer, just wanted to confirm.
