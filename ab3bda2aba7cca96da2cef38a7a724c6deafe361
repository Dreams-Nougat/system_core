final partition tbd.  The .cil file corresponding to device policy is nonplat_sepolicy.cil, which has in it the public policy included from the platform version it targets in addition to any new device-specific types, attributes and avc rules (just about everything else is verboten at present).  /plat_sepolicy.cil corresponds to the new platform version's policy, and /mapping_sepolicy.cil is all of the policy provided by the platform to make sure that the other two files work nicely together.

Is the cil routine setting errno, why PLOG?

I did not add any errno setting.  As for PLOG vs. LOG, dunno, I just followed the existing usage (enh@ would know previous justification here, if any).

if what you called set errno, you should use PLOG. if not, LOG.
