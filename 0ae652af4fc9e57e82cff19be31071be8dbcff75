Should this still be "metrics/c_metrics_library.h" since that file was moved to a metrics subfolder of include:  metrics/include/metrics/c_metrics_library.h?

I'm not too familiar with the proto header generation... does it actually generate the headers in /system/core/metrics/system/core/metrics/uploader/proto/*?  If so, that seems... redundant and unnecessarily deep path.  Some of the other headers seem to use "uploader/proto/<file>.pb.h" as the include path, which I'm guessing would be the better and more consistent use here.

Same question here, regarding "system/core/metrics" as part of the include lookup path.
