probably should have

LOCAL_MODULE_PATH := $(TARGET_OUT_DATA_NATIVE_TESTS)

for the target version of the test

see external/gtest/test/Android.mk for the generic gtest rule you might want to use (at least as reference)

Without this directive, the build system puts my test in

$(TARGET_OUT)/data/nativetest/ziparchive-tests/ziparchive-tests 

Is that not the right place ?

having your own main probably means you won't be runnable by the default tradefed test runner

Hmm, all I wanted was a command line argument of my own. Is there a better way to do this ? I looked around but couldn't find a good way to do it (though I did find several tests that had their own main)

I guess I could hardcode the path for the host test (assuming the test is being run from the root of the tree) and add a rule to push the data files to a known location on the device. Would that be preferable ?

I'm not sure, I would ask Tsu about how to arrange for data to be available for the test runner.
