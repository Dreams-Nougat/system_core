how many callers are there of these? should we just rewrite them to use UTF8ToWide/WideToUTF8 directly?

~14 callers to widen(), ~8 callers to narrow(). I think it makes sense to rewrite (especially because I like a non-fatal error-path), let me know the timing: in this commit or after?

Ok, I'm thinking as a separate commit so that the stuff is broken for a minimal amount of time.

why u8 rather than utf8? (for the files and the namespace.)

I think I was influenced by the C++ string literal prefix of 'u8', but it doesn't matter to me. Just give the word and I can change u8 => utf8.

yeah, u8's too new, man from the future :-)

Ok, I'll rename u8 stuff to utf8 in the next PS.

why don't we want to be able to just #include this file and have open et cetera just work, even on Windows? shouldn't the 'using's be in this file? (and if the reason is that we want the "wide" functions independently, let's just move them into their own header.)

So your idea is to put "using android::base::u8::open,unlink,etc" in this file? Then the caller would do the following?

namespace { // gotta put your code in a namespace
#include "base/u8.h"
void SomeFunction() {...
} // namespace

I can try prototyping that, just give me suggestions on the filenames for the files containing the wide funcs and this file full of "using's".

why do we need the anonymous namespace?

When I tried:

using android::base::u8::open;
void SomeFunc() {
open(...

Building host_cross_libbase_test said:

error: ‘open’ is already declared in this scope
 using android::base::u8::open;
                          ^
Weird, huh? Ideas?

Let me know what you think and I can continue prototyping.

no, let's definitely not consider anything other than deleting libutils :-)

we really do need to find the time to work on Win32 libc++ though. hopefully in 2016.

Ok, so libutils is crufty, I gather? Anyway, let me know if I should edit libutils/Unicode.cpp out of this comment.

very crufty.

the libchrome vs libbase question is an excellent one, and we should really come up with an actual plan on that front, but libutils is definitely something we'd like to kill.

Ok, I'll remove it from the comments in the next PS.
