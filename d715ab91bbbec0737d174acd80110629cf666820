This will cause every argument to every service to be in memory twice, which doesn't seem necessary.  Can you find a way to use the original copy if there were no properties in it?  It will probably be ugly, since you can't free args[i].

If you're ok with ugliness, then yes it's definitely possible. I'll change this.

There's also a performance (not memory) optimization I have in mind for expand_props for the case where there isn't an expansion. I'll apply that too.

i figured we just have different imports for the different static configuration choices.

What do you expect extra_args to be used for?

There are at least two things I have in mind :

(i) --start_secondary : exec the secondary zygote as soon as the primary is started.
(ii) (?) --zygote_abi=abi : Unless there's a clean way for the zygote to determine what ABI it's using, it has to be told. That way, the ActivityManager can just say "startProcess with String abi="abi" and the right zygote will start it.

So, (i) can be replaced by a system property, and so can (ii) .

In fact, if we want to be less general, we can assume there will be a maximum of two zygotes and one of them *must* be 64 bits and the other *must be 32*. Then the ActivityManager can say "startProcess boolean is64=false" on it's zygote connection.

Depends on how flexible we want to be, and how strong our aversion for additional arguments like this is.
