Internally it would be nice if we supported a "reinit" that only changed the filter if persist.logd.filter changed. The algorithm is more complicated than the corner case deserves since reinit is controlled by our init task and typically happens at 3 seconds into boot, and after the /data filesystem mounts. A person doing 'restart logd-reinit' will cause any runtime changes (logcat -P) to be erased; we accept that.
