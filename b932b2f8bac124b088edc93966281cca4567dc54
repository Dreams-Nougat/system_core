Main difference between this WEAK _today_ and the others is that currently there is no public access to the open-coded fragment in the dependent (circular) library. Leaving it static makes sense today, but allows us to find, with code-search, the open-coded fragments that have been noticed so far.

WTH: Changed this to "%Y- prefix would be redundant given the typical timespan" and it returned to original :-(
