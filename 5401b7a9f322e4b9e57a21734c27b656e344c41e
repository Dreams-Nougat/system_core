No, this is necessary to tell the kernel that the firmware is not coming so it can fail the driver's call to request_firmware.

so just opening the file starts the process then? not the write of "1" in load_firmware?

luckily they're all done in separate children that we don't wait for, so i don't think it matters. remove this logging (which is new in this change)?

The size of these files can vary dramatically. How big are the files for the longest uploads (sar0_CY8C.img)?

The logging looks useful, although I might drop the time, and add the name of the device it was sent to?
