but it still installs them does it not?

I see this message when installing apps to n9 - the apps get installed.

hmm. that sounds more like the other non-adb bug --- that the install command is no longer reporting "Success" to us, even though we rely on it.

Yeah, I noticed that yesterday and fixed 835515. But, that only caught one install path, I need to fix the other.

Btw do we still need this "success" string check?  When I filed a feature request about adb install's status code (b/16326499), xav told me it was because the adb protocol doesn't support returning the status code back.  But it looks like now it's supported?  Like "adb shell exit 3; echo $?" now properly shows "3".  Can't we just use that instead?
