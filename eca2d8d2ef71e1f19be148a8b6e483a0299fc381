Looks like this is the only actual change in this CL. I wonder if it makes sense to split this CL into two? One would just have the no-op changes to change "sockaddr" to "sockaddr_storage" and the other would contain this change. That would have the advantage that if this change breaks something it can be rolled back by itself without impacting the sockaddr_storage changes.

LGTM either way though.
