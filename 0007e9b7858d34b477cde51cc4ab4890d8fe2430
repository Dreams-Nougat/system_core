I'm a little nervous about this because http://r.android.com/182080 tried this and apparently caused some breakage.

However I can't seem to replicate the failure, I cleaned my build then ran both `m checkbuild` and `lunch sdk-eng; make -j40 win_sdk` without problem.

Is there any other build I should try?

i remember cleaning up some gettid stuff, so maybe i just never came back to revert the revert?

Looks like the un-revert is at http://r.android.com/182090, but it doesn't contain the fastboot dependency on libcutils because you moved gettid to libbase.

If it was in fact a fastboot dependency on libcutils causing the build breakage, it might show up again here, I just can't figure out how to replicate it if that's the case.

so maybe it shouldn't be public?

Yeah I think you're right, I'll move it elsewhere.

Small change needed for Mac, recvfrom() behaves differently on TCP sockets. Will put the fix in the next patch set.
