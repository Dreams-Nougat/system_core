After looking at some of the other changes needed in other projects ... 
A size_t seems more appropriate, or an off_t.

the problem is our LP32 libc is fucked. both size_t and off_t (and time_t) are just 32 bits. if you need to handle > 2GiB on LP32, you'll need to use off64_t.

argh. So the 
   #define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
doesn't work as expected for off_t?
We use it in some places.
