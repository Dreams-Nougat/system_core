Auditd Daemon

The audit daemon is a simplified version of its desktop
counterpart designed to gather the audit logs from the
audit kernel subsystem. The audit subsystem of the kernel
includes Linux Security Modules (LSM) messages as well.

The daemon maintains two log files audit.log and audit.old
at /data/misc/audit/. On boot, if audit.log exists, and
the size is greater than 0, audit.log is renamed to
audit.old. The log file is also renamed, or rotated, when
a threshold is hit. This threshold is hard-coded to 100KB
but can be adjusted through the AUDITD_MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZEKB
Makefile file variable that can be overridden in the device.mk

The daemon is not included by default, and must explicitly be
added to PRODUCT_PACKAGES. This could be set in the device.mk

The daemon also has no external interfaces, but one could
use inotify to start and build a system from this.

Example configuration in device.mk:

# 1MB Log file threshold
AUDITD_MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZEKB := 1000

PRODUCT_PACKAGES += auditd
