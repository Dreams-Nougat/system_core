haven't tested if this is fine on a device, or will that behave like linux?

there is no consistent formatting or logic to the names i've picked, so i'm happy to replace with something else.

Can you leave a link to this in a comment: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xcb2z8hs.aspx

That explains how to do it for Windows, but it is somewhat a moot point because it only works when debugging (i.e. Windows ps equivalent does not show this info) and no one debugs adb on Windows because the build process does not generate PDB debugging files (because gcc doesn't produce it, unlike Visual Studio).

If you want to see other implementations of setting a thread name, see ART SetThreadName: http://androidxref.com/5.1.1_r6/xref/art/runtime/utils.cc#987 , and libutils/Threads.cpp: androidSetThreadName. I think the former handles all the Linux vs. MacOS, plus the 16 char max which is a real headache.

I think this is also used for TCP connections, right? (adb connect as well as emulator)
