or lose cutils_socket_buffer and just pass void*[] and size_t[] (and a size_t for the number of elements) to socket_send_buffers?

ah. sneaky. are we sure we want socket_set_buffer rather than just structure initializers? (since the name is awkward, i wonder if structure initializers might look more natural?)

The structure members have different names and the order is swapped between platforms so neither designated initializers or ordered initializers will work cross-platform, there has to be some abstraction.

But yeah this approach isn't great, I'll look into changing it to what you suggest in the other comment.
