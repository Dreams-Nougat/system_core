It is not hard to add a gTest to confirm this feature in the tests/logcat_tests.cpp file. You may have to borrow from the tests that inject input and confirm end-to-end.

For logId = LOG_ID_EVENTS or LOG_ID_SECURITY you are dealing with a raw binary buffer here. You could chose to skip, or maybe we can consider it a feature to rely on libpcre to deal with it?

The alternative is to regex the formatted output string and not worry about it. A small refactor of the code below (look at logprint.c:android_log_printLogLine, snarf that as open-coded) can allow you to switch to the formatted content.

FYI: binary content packets contain int32_t and int64_t in nl-order and may contain an embedded string object. The tag is a numerical lookup.
