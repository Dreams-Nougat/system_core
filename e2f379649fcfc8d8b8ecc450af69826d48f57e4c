Opted for a hard limit rather than dynamically allocating memory for speed and simplicity. I expect most usage will be to transmit 2 buffers, a header and a body, so I don't think this will be a problem.

enh: you recommended C++ for this file in https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/199435/2/libcutils/sockets.c@39.

I think the linkage may not matter here because nobody is using this file except fastboot, but it makes more sense to me to leave everything as C if switching some files to C++ can break stuff, so I changed this as well. LMK if you would rather I leave it as C++.

no, it's not switching to C++ that can break stuff. it's just using the STL that's awkward. it's still worth moving to C++ for all the other reasons.
