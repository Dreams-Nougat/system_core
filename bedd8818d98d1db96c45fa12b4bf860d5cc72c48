Host dex2oat needs to link with libcutils now, because it has tracing in it. This is needed to build the shared library it links with.

Are you suggesting I should link to libcutils statically on the host, and then we don't need this?

I don't understand.

Are you suggesting I move the entire implementation of the atrace functions into the trace.h header file?

Otherwise, the above vars and below definitions are needed to match the corresponding vars and definitions used on the target side.
