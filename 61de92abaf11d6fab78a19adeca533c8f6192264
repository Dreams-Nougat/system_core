i think this would be more readable and less scary the other way around. so this has "/data/adb/adb-%s-%d.txt" and the strftime just does the date.

(what scares me, in case it isn't obvious, is non-constant format strings. not because i think we have a bug in strftime but because they make me think a lot harder than i should need to.)

why do you think this is sufficient? wasn't part of the point of the old scheme that if someone accidentally tries to read from stdin, you're not reading from whatever random fd becomes fd 0 after you close stdin?
