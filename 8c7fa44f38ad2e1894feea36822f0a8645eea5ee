I just learned about TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY, which would make this much simpler:

TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY(waitpid(pid, NULL, 0));

Thank you for the suggestion, Colin.

However I'm slightly confused by comment from "dalvik/libnativehelper/include/nativehelper/JNIHelp.h":

"TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY is defined by some, but not all, versions of <unistd.h>. (Alas, it is not as standard as we'd hoped!)".

As we can see there, they explicitly define the macro if it is not yet defined.

In our case, the TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY macro is not defined inside "system/core" subproject, therefore we shoud either:
   * [re-]define it in some header inside "system/core" (like done in "dalvik/libnativehelper/include/nativehelper/JNIHelp.h")
or
   * avoid using it and stay within the solution from "Patch Set 2" (my personal preference).

Looking forward your opinion.
