you don't need the cleanspec, there are proper dependencies between system/core/rootdir/init.rc and $OUT/root/init.rc.

where do you override this if you have an x86_64 device?

Both options we have here kinda suck.

We could have separate zygote config files for x86 / mips but that's a lot of pointless duplication and it's easy to muck things up.

We could move these to the board configs (which is slightly less sucky) but then the information about zygote configuration is scattered all over the place. (i.e, it isn't clear what each zygote handles)

yeah, that's what made my gut think that the board configs would be the less worse place.

you could always ask intel what they think, since they'll have to deal with this pretty soon anyway...

We already have all the abis in ro.product.cpu.abilist, how hard would it be for zygote to autodetect which of those abis it supports?

Alternatively, we could easily add ro.product.cpu.abilist32 and ro.product.cpu.abilist64 from the same BoardConfig.mk variables, and use __LP64__ to decide which to look at in zygote.

I think it's not very easy for the zygote to autodetect what ABIs it supports without a few manual tweaks (a single compiled zygote could support multiple ABIs)

Further, It's not just the zygote that needs to know what ABIs it supports. The system_server needs to know which ABI each zygote supports.

(I suppose I could implement that by having the system_server query the ABI list from the zygote as soon as it opens the connection.)

I do like Colin's idea of using ro.product.cpu.abis32 / abis64 but the issue there is that there are no *existing* BoardConfig.mk variables I could use unless I can assume that TARGET_CPU is 64 bit if TARGET_2ND_CPU is present.

There is TARGET_IS_64_BIT that determines if the primary target is 64-bit or 32-bit.  Secondary target is always assumed to be 32-bit.
