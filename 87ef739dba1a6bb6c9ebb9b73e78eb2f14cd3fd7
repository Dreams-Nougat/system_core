why don't we need the mkdir any more?

This logic was done since authentication was first added, but it probably doesn't actually serve any use?

The emulator sets it to false (i.e. it always wants the real home directory).

The function that gets the adbkey path is the caller that sets it to true. Hmm, this is to avoid annoying folders in the user's home directory? If so, there's a canonical place to put stuff in that we should be using instead.

Sorry, I don't know of the correct answer here. I can tell you the various places we use:

1. ~/.android
2. Android Studio itself uses the folders that vary with the platform: https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544519-Directories-used-by-the-IDE-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs

A few months ago we had someone complaining that we are polluting the home directory, and he had a link to some authoritative linux recommendation. I've forgotten what that was but http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html seems like a possibility. That seems to give a specific recommendation for lock files: http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARLOCKLOCKFILES.

I don't know if any of that helps, but if you start with $HOME/.android, I'd be perfectly fine with that as long as you are using it specifically for tiny files. (Specifically because $HOME/.android is where we keep a uid.txt)

If you need a more specific recommendation, let me know and I can email the team.
