This is a pointless change since I've been told that the new libcxx will have a real std::mutex implementation.

Yes, but that's still on the order of months away (I believe).

We're also near bumping the minimum version up to Vista (which will be required for libc++ support), so we could just do that now and use a SRWLock here. AIUI they're more performant, and we don't need the recursive locking semantics here.

Ah, so you're saying that a SRWLock is better than a critical section? Cool. That is new to me because most of my Win32 sync knowledge is from before SRWLock existed. But I can believe it, so let me know if you want me to change this to SRWLock or if you want to take care of it yourself. Thanks.

I tested this and in the common success case, errno is not overwritten. So this is really 'just in case'.
