I think we should remove this logic. If the property is not set, it should be considered a configuration error.

i agree in general, but i worry about systems that suddenly go silent because a property got reset.  where is the storage for these things ?  the prop files in / ?  so it's not actually mutable ?  if that's the case, then OK, this can be an error.
