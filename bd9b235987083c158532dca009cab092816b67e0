if partition_wiped() executes, it has the potential to modify errno, making the strerror(errno) on line 579 print a misleading value.

Can you save errno before this block to avoid the problem?

Looking back at my logs the code never went this route, I went the second branch below. __mount() is safe from my observation. I think the proper fix is to move this up to under the mount.. not on this branch.
