not these?

i mean, you'd have to visit the computer history museum for a big-endian host, so personally i'd just remove all these *_to_le* calls, but if you're going to add them, you may as well try to add them all. (the fact that you'll never find them all because you don't have a big-endian host to test on is part of the reason i wouldn't even try :-) .)

Missed them..
I was looking at wikipedia.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set
"Since almost all MIPS microprocessors have the capability of operating with either little endian or big endian byte order, the term is used only for processors where little endian byte order has been pre-determined."

I thought Android supports MIPS as well. I might be wrong here..

Do you still think it's worth submitting this patch ?

we support mips, but only little-endian. there's no big-endian code in the VM or libc, nor any interest in adding any. personally i'd remove the existing uses here rather than add new ones.

(i hadn't noticed that this is actually device code --- we really ought to rename this file! it confuses me every time!)
