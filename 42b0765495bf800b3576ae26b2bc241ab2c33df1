If you don't find this too annoying it should be fine, but if the delay is too long or we want more wiggle room than 1 second it might be better to run the check in a loop, something like:

  end_time = time.time() + 3
  while self.device.shell_nocheck(proc_query)[0] != 1:
    self.assertFalse(time.time() > end_time,
                     'subprocess failed to terminate in time')
