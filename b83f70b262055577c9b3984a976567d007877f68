Shall we tighten getFlattenedSize() to real build.id size, maybe in another patch?

Probably worth doing in a separate CL, if we care enough about this code.  My immediate goal here was just to make the tests runnable again.

Is this README.txt useful? There is no special rule to run libutils_tests comparing to other native tests.

I would much rather point to generic instructions.  Are there any?

I have gotten frustrated by the many different ways we have to run tests.  The fact that these tests included one that can't actually work suggests I'm not the only one having trouble running tests.

I don't know, maybe there is no native test instruction for aosp. Bionic has similiar instructions in bionic/README.md (Device tests section), maybe you can make this file more formal by copying part of it.

define INITIAL_STRONG_VALUE in this file and use it instead? so we can get rid of the comment.

Why not omit the test on uniprocessor?

Probably better.  Will do.
