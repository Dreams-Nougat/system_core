This use of ANDROID_LOG_VERBOSE is the 'inert' level of 'enforcement'

ToDo: consider implications of a runtime check of ro.built.type where "user" sets a default of ANDROID_LOG_DEBUG (or even ANDROID_LOG_INFO?) as per the discussion(s) incited during the Bootcamp talks on the new logger.

ghackmann and others point out that some subsystems make _all_ messages ANDROID_LOG_ERROR. The world has never been capable of dealing with Megalomaniacs or a Jerk driving a BMW 7 series in the HOV lane.
