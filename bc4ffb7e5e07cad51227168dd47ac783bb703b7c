why pointers? it never makes sense to pass NULL, right?

Narayan told me that ziparchive public API has to be c compatible. Are references c compatible? I thought not but I'm not an expert in c/c++ world.

oh, i didn't realize this was public API. i don't see any C code #include this, so why does this have to support C?

Hmm. My memory must be failing me. I remember there being a couple of C callers. Code search never lies, though. We must have deleted them (a la dalvik) or moved them to C++.

fine by me for wider changes, but since you're already changing this line anyway you may as well use const&.

can these functions be switched over to const ZipEntryName& instead of the pair of arguments?

I think they can since they are private.

Thanks Elliott. I don't know why I was thinking that delete of a null pointer does something bad. I think I've read such thing somewhere but it must have been a bad source.

back in K&R days it wasn't portable. it's been fine since ANSI C, and it's always been allowed in C++.
