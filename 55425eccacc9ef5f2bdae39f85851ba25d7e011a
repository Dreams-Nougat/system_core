Shouldn't you check for truncation?

This is done by snprintf().

The idea is that the format_xxx functions use the same convention that snprintf() on Posix: always perform safe truncation (i.e. always append a final zero), but return the size of the full string anyway.

This allows you to call the function twice, the first time with buffer == NULL and buffer_len == 0, and the function returns the number of bytes you need for the output.

The second time, you call it with buffer != NULL, and buffer_len = required_size + 1, the extra 1 is required for the terminating zero (if you use required_size instead, the zero gets tucked at the end, erasing your last byte).

That's what the format_listeners code does.

We can't just return the value of snprintf() here directly because on Windows, the function is broken and will return -1 in case of truncation (yeah), and this code runs on the host.

If you prefer, I can use a different convention, but then I'll have to implement two functions: one to compute the size, and the other to do the write.
