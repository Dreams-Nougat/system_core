is it just me that thinks we should at least have a "toolbox" and a "selinux-toolbox" (and just make md5 a stand-alone tool)?

what would that gain you?  it would just duplicate the tool launching code into two executables, and it would make it harder to use a statically compiled toolbox (which we do every so often for early bringup).

ah, so there is still a static toolbox somewhere?

(my only interest here is that every time i strace date and see the dynamic linker opening a bunch of shared libraries it doesn't need, i think i should look into what's going on.)

there isn't a static version, but when we need one we compile it manually.  it's useful to push to a ramdisk when storage isn't working yet.
