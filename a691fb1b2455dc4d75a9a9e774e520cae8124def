You misread me.

This code is now a bastardized version of the NULL check for argv[0] and I stated it was unnecessary. You can not do + 1 since strrchr can return a NULL and now me will be a dereferenced NULL pointer. Please revert back. This one is 'fragile' because it was open-coded as we can see as you made a common mistake in refactoring it.

Revert back, or take enh's suggestion to switch to the alternate char * basename(const char *path). This one is fragile because a change elsewhere, or switching includes, can cause it to switch back to the posix variant ...
