Given the recent __ANDROID__ vs __BIONIC__ cleanups, this error doesn't match the ifdef. It seems like we'll want at least a stub system properties implementation for host bionic?

But we don't pass that on to the caller?

Properties with an empty value can exist, right? If so, should this return a bool instead, denoting whether a property was found?

as you can see, i was a bit confused on that point myself. yes, they can. but the existing APIs (other than doing what you see here) don't let you tell the difference. i'm not sure whether that difference is useful: setting a default seems to be the actual usual intent.

i think just replacing this comment with something like "if unset, leave `value` so it can serve as a default" is fine.
