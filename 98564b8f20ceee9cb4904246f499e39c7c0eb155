/data/anr should not be writable to the shell user. Known security hole.

Sorry, misread 751.  It's not writable to the "logs" group.

Still, the system server creates /data/anr, and we shouldn't be recreating it here (with different permissions).  And I believe the system server also creates /data/tombstones.
