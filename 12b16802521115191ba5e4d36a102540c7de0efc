i still think what you learned was more subtle than this. honestly, i think it's probably confusing to even mention the other two. these functions read/write a full fixed-sized buffer. they really have nothing to do with strings except that C makes it hard to distinguish.

(i'm not even sure my rewording above is really clear. maybe talk about Java's readFully(byte[]) and write(byte[]) instead, since they have the equivalent behaviors?)
