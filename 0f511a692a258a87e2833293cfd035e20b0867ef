Is there a reason you aren't just storing this as a long? I didn't see any obvious reason to keep it a string.

see L364 --- everyone else translates pr < -9 into the string "RT". rather than complicate the already messy printf part of the code, i do this translation when i read pr rather than when i output it.

there's no such tradition for ni, so it's just stored as a long.
