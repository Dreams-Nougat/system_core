well, ADB_HOST undefined. this isn't adb, this is just a stand-alone library that happened to come from adb.

Include a link to ubuntu.com? :)

Do you want to hoist the less useful mac/windows messages into the library as well? All of the cases in this CL are "no permissions", but idk enough about what's going on here to know if you can always say that or not.

Do we want "&& !defined(__ANDROID__)" here as well? Or was that just necessary above to get around compiler errors?
