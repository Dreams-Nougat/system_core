If I'm reading this the right way, exec is a short-hand way of specifying an anonymous one-shot service. The child is asynchronous, so we'd still have to use execonce for tasks like building the fstab and getting the display resolution.

Currently, the init language supports a "start" directive, for starting a defined service. So this would be a replacement for declaring a service and then someone starting it, right?

If so, when would we recommend that someone use this "exec" vs just creating a one-shot service which does the same thing? I want to make sure we're not introducing unnecessary complexity here.
