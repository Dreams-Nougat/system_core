Change to "This new function is guaranteed ..."

NB: the same can _not_ be said of the ALOGE calls above, but at least errno is preserved up to the point it is passed as an argument as a precursor to the liblog logging APIs. Most of the library is tuned to return -errno values, but nothing has been done to preserve the global errno. This can be a gotcha, but is outside the scope of this CL.
