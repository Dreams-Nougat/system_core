Not accurate because credential GID checking not performed. Checking in LogListener.cpp (when fixed) is accurate and is _the_ line of defense. No need for us to do the checking here _except_ to bypass is_loggable.

Not strictly needed here and below because we do not have spam filter on security buffer, required for completeness and accuracy.

wrong logic, messed up by trying to put clientHasLogCredentials last, or trying to do pre-check of local copies of uid. Here is accurate, but does not place clientHasLogCredentials last:

if ((header->id == LOG_ID_SECURITY) && ((cred->uid != AID_SYSTEM) && (cred->uid != AID_ROOT) && !clientHasLogCredentials(cli)) || !__android_log_security())) {

Here is KISS accurate dropping pre-check:

if ((header->id == LOG_ID_SECURITY) && (!__android_log_security() || !clientHasLogCredentials(cli)) {
