'no ID_DONE' is a pretty useless error message, especially when it happens because of EOF, resulting in the message 'failed to copy foo to bar: no ID_DONE: Success'. I don't think any other errors are plausible, since the fd is actually an internal socketpair.

Maybe 'disconnected from device' would be better?

or "couldn't read from device", which is strictly true, sounds specific, but is still vague enough.
