I think the reason D() used a lock was because there used to be two calls to fprintf(), but enh changed that recently. Base logging uses a lock around the logger.

I was going to suggest removing the errno saving/restoring because I do that in LOG(), but I just tested it and I didn't do it correctly (damn, I should have written a test for it).

yes, the errno has been saved in LOG(). But StringPrintf and __VA_ARGS__ may change errno (__VA_ARGS__ is possible to contain function calls). I don't know if there is any guarantee in c++ that LOG(INFO) can go strictly before its parameters following operator<<().

Yeah, I'll put this on my list to investigate (or someone else can feel free to beat me to it).
