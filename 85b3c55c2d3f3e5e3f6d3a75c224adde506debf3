you don't need the cleanspec, there are proper dependencies between system/core/rootdir/init.rc and $OUT/root/init.rc.

where do you override this if you have an x86_64 device?

Both options we have here kinda suck.

We could have separate zygote config files for x86 / mips but that's a lot of pointless duplication and it's easy to muck things up.

We could move these to the board configs (which is slightly less sucky) but then the information about zygote configuration is scattered all over the place. (i.e, it isn't clear what each zygote handles)

yeah, that's what made my gut think that the board configs would be the less worse place.

you could always ask intel what they think, since they'll have to deal with this pretty soon anyway...

We already have all the abis in ro.product.cpu.abilist, how hard would it be for zygote to autodetect which of those abis it supports?

Alternatively, we could easily add ro.product.cpu.abilist32 and ro.product.cpu.abilist64 from the same BoardConfig.mk variables, and use __LP64__ to decide which to look at in zygote.
