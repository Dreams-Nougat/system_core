dirname seems to work, but I'm marginally happy with the way the code turned out. Seems kind of ugly.

I didn't write all the other win32 tests (slash, backslash, UNC paths, Unicode) because you guys should accept/rewrite my https://android-review.googlesource.com/151895 first. :)

I attempted to fix this in https://android-review.googlesource.com/151895, but I'm not happy with that fix (too ugly). Feel free to fix that in a more 'proper' way.

as long as we export adb_dirname, i think that's actually a pro --- makes it easier to not fuck up this kind of thing for Windows in future.
