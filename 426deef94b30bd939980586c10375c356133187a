don't you think the better fix is to ask for the FUSE version we actually need?

i think it's a long-standing error that we've been _requesting_ the highest version our header files have heard of, rather than the version we actually expect.

 * Version negotiation:
 *
 * Both the kernel and userspace send the version they support in the
 * INIT request and reply respectively.
 *
 * If the major versions match then both shall use the smallest
 * of the two minor versions for communication.
 *
 * If the kernel supports a larger major version, then userspace shall
 * reply with the major version it supports, ignore the rest of the
 * INIT message and expect a new INIT message from the kernel with a
 * matching major version.
 *
 * If the library supports a larger major version, then it shall fall
 * back to the major protocol version sent by the kernel for
 * communication and reply with that major version (and an arbitrary
 * supported minor version).

so it looks like we really ought to just copy across the kernel's major and minor from the in struct and just check that they're at least some minimum version we understand.

it looks like only the minor version has been bumped.

how about

  if (req->major > FUSE_KERNEL_VERSION || (req->major == FUSE_KERNEL_VERSION && req->minor > FUSE_KERNEL_MINOR_VERSION) {
    ALOGW("kernel reported FUSE version %d.%d, we were compiled with headers for %d.%d", ...);
    out.major = FUSE_KERNEL_VERSION; // or some hard-coded version that's what we actually need?
    out.minor = FUSE_KERNEL_MINOR_VERSION; // or some hard-coded version that's what we actually need?
  } else {
    out.major = req->major;
    out.minor = req->minor;
  }

?

I changed this to take into account the fuse structures mismatching between the code and the compiled version.
