In theory, the reboot request could be denied, at which point this will return an error. And the boot will continue on.

Like we do in init/builtins.cpp, I would recommend adding the following line after this line:

  while (1) { pause(); }  // never reached

to handle this particular case and make sure the boot doesn't continue.

Oh I see. I had been wondering why the never reached code is there. It makes more sense now. The comment is slightly misleading.
