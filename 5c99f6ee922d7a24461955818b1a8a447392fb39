just to confirm:
all these options mean the same thing?

yes, except some are not relevant for each linked command name (*.cat *.start and *.stop) as you see below. There is minimal checking if the options are selected and not used at line 41, 50 and 63. This is a 'developer' command never released on "user".

It is getting complicated enough that we may resort to delivering a binary based off C++ for this. But as you can see it is a throw-away in the future. The script has grown from an original of 5 lines ...

The eventual goal is to deprecate the script and replace it with menus in Developer Options as per b/28120456. It remains a stretch goal (as officially I have no Java readability ;-} although evidence shows otherwise).

if it has a value, we need to confirm that ${size} is numerical-only, and is within range.

[ 0 -lt ${size} ] 2>/dev/null will be false if size is non-numerical and also checks if we have a positive value (bonus).

We can use 'logcat -b ${buffer} -g >/dev/null 2>&1' return code to check the validity of the buffer set if it is [ -n "${buffer}" ].

is there a better alternative to raw user ids ?

Nope, once you are running on the system, the number is but a distant memory in the source files, or part of a binary android_ids[] list. There is a separate effort going on to solve this kind of issue b/27999086 so that names to AID translations are centralized and unified. Once done, even init.rc files can take names for _all_ AIDs.

su will be fixed to take names when b/27999086 is in phase 5 (stretch goals and improvements).

Look at logcatd.rc, this trigger a series of actions on property. One of the final actions is to exec logcat with a set of parameters. sleep is, what it is ... gives time for init to react.
