Is this actually "if device is USB, disconnect and let device polling automatically reconnect. Otherwise, if TCP, just disconnect"?

FWIW, when I was debugging Windows USB issues, I overloaded adb disconnect to be able to disconnect USB devices (and then let the device polling automatically reconnect). I never checked-in that change since it was just for debugging. The benefit was that I didn't have to add a new host:reconnect command. I don't know if this is a better route than what you've got.
