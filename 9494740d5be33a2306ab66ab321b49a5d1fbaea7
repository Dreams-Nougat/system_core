this seems like a lot of work to go to just to write a test that will always fail.

why not just 

  #if defined(__ANDROID__)
  #endif

around the whole body of this test instead? it's meaningless on the host anyway.

(if you look at the bionic tests, we sometimes have an explicit log statement in a #else explaining why the test is meaningless in the #else case, but that's not necessary.)
