Yeah, this sort of heuristic is going to cause a lot of pain.

Why not just assume UTF-8 unless the entire archive is CP-437 ? That's really the safest thing to do since any API that guesses things like this likely to be flaky / surprising.

(Assuming CP-437 in this scenario is dangerous, because then we are essentially ignoring the entry_name length of each entry).
