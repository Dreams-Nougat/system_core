-L with -f or -L always?

Will add a comma after -L to group the list linguistically.

Formerly -f would 'blindly' go into background regardless of any other flags. This was done because we would coalesce continuing content in batches, and make sure that while writing logrotate content we do not use up enough cpu cycles to affect foreground activities. As new log content arrives, we limit our wakeups to process the content.

However, -d, -t and -L all result in a terminate content, in that logcat does not continue to sit around waiting for new content, it stops once it hits the end.

In these cases we get better behavior from logcat if we are in the foreground cgroup.

Not seeing -f going to background in the code. You said "formally" so does it mean it used to be that way in the past?

Now it seems to me we're mentioning -d and -t to have a description of the overall status right now, and at the same time we're mentioning -f to get a sense of what's been changing.

I think either the description can focus on the current status, or the delta since the last commit. For the former, I'd just say -d -t and -L won't go into background. For the latter, I'd say switching -L to foreground to keep up with -d and -t.

Sorry about the nit-picking here. :)

The title needs to be accurate and succinct (eg: <70 characters).

The replacement title will likely read:

logcat: -d, -t or -L, along with -f, do not set background cgroup

The body of the message describes why we are doing this, and can be as wordy as necessary to get the point across.

I said formerly ;-}, as in before this CL.

In the current code -f sets the global filename, and thus the whole process goes to background cgroup, batch scheduling and process priority regardless of which other flags are used.

The change is that if one uses any one or more of the -d, -t and -L flags in any combination, and also one specifies the -f flag, that we will _not_ go into the background cgroup (and thus _not_ cause a priority inversion).

I don't like this part, but this is not your fault. You're a victim because the function signature has to changed for a not-so-obvious reason.

This is setting the priority of the process, without anything to do with the output. IMO this could have been taken outside to form a function of its own.

This is a static function, do not care if the signature changes.

Checking outside means that the caller also needs to understand the meanings of g_outputFileName. The policy for output remains here.

The eventual goal is to remove all g_* variables and make them part of the function variables, but that is outside the scope of the fix here. This is but a first step towards that goal _perhaps_.

> This is a static function, do not care if the signature changes.

This is true. Signature change is the end result. Regardless of that I don't think this is written cleanly. What I don't like is it's not like the output will be any different when mode changes. The output only depends on the file name. Scheduling depends on both the file name and mode. It's only this common dependency on the file name that holds these two parts together in this one function. And the function name doesn't even reflect the scheduling.

Yeah. The global variables can be eliminated by passing them in the parameters. In that case eventually I hope we can say setupOutput(name); setScheduling(name, mode).

Feel free to ignore this comment, as this is not introduced by you. And this is perhaps not the most important part of the code.

Will setupOutputAndPolicy(bool blocking) and setupOutputAndPolicy(mode & ANDROID_LOG_NONBLOCK) make you happier for this moment? If not, I will split it.

Splitting this into two functions is clearer from one maintenance perspective, but the pair of functions would _still_ need to be called in tight sequence; moving one or the other around (and if you look at the patch set in this series, this is happening) and thus introduces maintenance risk. As soon as we consider opening the output file, we want to drop to background cgroup.

I may wish to reconsider this, maybe it is better to set the priority just before we _really_ start reading, rather than when we decide to open the output file for writing? (my answer will come when I respin this CL in the patch series)

The background cgroup policy is closely tied to where/what the input is coming from and where the output is going, and controls the flow rate of the input and output.

FYI the mode argument is actually representing the _input_ mode.

Not really. But I don't think this part is super important either. So adding a TODO will probably make me the happiest. :)

In that case we're creating the freedom and we're making a conscientious choice to group the calls together, rather than being forced to lump them.

Yes. This part is clear. I'm not complaining about output isn't accepting mode.

ToDo: We should switch to using libminijail, except that is _new_ and not in N,
