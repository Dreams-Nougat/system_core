I know this is unrelated to this change, but if I understand it correctly, you just want to say 'enforcing' on the kernel command line? If so, this is a really bad name. This should be something like androidboot.selinux.enforcing=XXX and androidboot.selinux.enabled.

I don't see why we need to special case this stuff.

You can feel free to upload the fix for this in a separate patch.

why do we only restart these guys? what happens to other running services like mediaserver, system_server, etc.

Those are the only services that need to re-read the slinux policy files.

The other services seem to cope with this just fine.

yes, but if teh mediaserver is the one that does video recording and you change the policy, it will run with the old contexts, right? Or if the running apps touch their files while the policy changes, won't all of them need to be restarted? I'm a little out of my depth here so I don't know what the ramifications are.
