Sorry, it made sense in my head.

While calling dump_crash, eventually there is a call to _LOG, which makes a call to write_to_am. If write_to_am returns <= 0, then that function sets log->amfd = -1 (without actually closing the fd). Thus you can have a non-negative log.amfd to start with, but wind up with a -1 if a write fails.

This error case happens normally if the process being dumped isn't an activity, and the activity manager close the connection.

but doesn't that mean this code is still wrong? you need to cache the result from activity_manager_connect above, and pass that to close here?

(and i still i don't see what that has to do with nnk's "just call close(2) and let it worry about -1" comment.)
