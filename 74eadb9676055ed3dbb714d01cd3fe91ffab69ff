really? that seems retarded. can't you fix that?

the uapi mips stat.h has "unsigned long st_mtime". are you sure the real problem here isn't that bionic's stat.h has the wrong definition for mips64's struct stat?

The uapi mips stat.h under _MIPS_SIM_ABI64 has unsigned int (32-bit) st_mtime.

can't you fix that? surely you don't want to go backwards with your new architecture?

(and surely the last thing mips needs is _new_ source-level incompatibilities with everyone else?)

We are looking into possible solutions to have a better fix. Modifying the stat structure is not a possibility as it would break existing MIPS64 binaries but may be another definition of the structure could be created for Android.
