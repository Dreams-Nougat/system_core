This defines an int :-( in several public implementations, this makes me unhappy :-(. But we will buy this for $10

i'm a bit uncomfortable with the 38;5; and use of the 256-color palette (especially because you haven't documented that). can't you restrict yourself to the traditional colors? do the Mac and Windows support the 256-color xterm palette?

I documented it at the top where the color references are. There is a url that points to an instructive page regarding xterm palette and the used of ESC [ 3 8 ; 5 ; <color> m sequence.

I will fortify the comment a bit more to hopefully make you happier.

As indicated in the original CL, I was not comfortable with it not using one of the terminal character libraries; when I realized we have no interest in holding on to such bulk. This is a KISS 'most terminals supported' adjustment ... if colors do not work on your terminal, supply a CL to fix it ;-> based on a new ANDROID_TERM environment variable ...
