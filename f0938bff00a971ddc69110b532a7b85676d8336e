why don't we just unconditionally compile all this and have the #if around the caller?

I mildly prefer this, even though you did have to add the extra guards to fix the clangs. The two advantages is that we do have an implementation for the #else case, however simple, and the guards are visible in the dangerous code - in fact, the new guards totally remove the dangerous code.

So I vote for keeping this as is.
