Does trusty keymaster HAL only support v0.3 at this moment? any reason of not using KEYMASTER_MODULE_API_VERSION_2_0?
or any plan to support 2.0?

We should definitely update this to support 2.0. Unless there's a reason to push this in quickly, I suggest that we hold off until I can update it to 2.0.

Got it. Previously I assumed that Trusty should be ready in N, and N requires Keymaster 2.0, so I would think this code supported 2.0 then.

And I think it should be ready for 2.0 before or at N release?

I should be able to update it to 2.0 before N release.
