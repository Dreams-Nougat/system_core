that's pretty bizarre syntax. seems like if we actually need optional labels, it would make more sense to allow '-' to mean auto-transition?

I find '-' a bit too cryptic.

In addition, it may not be an auto-transition at all? Could this also mean inherit context from init?

@nnk@ if we were to create a dummy-arg for SECLABEL, what would be intuitive to the selinux crowd?

What about _both_, this certainly would lighten the burden on the init-writer.

What about the word "default"?

  exec default logd log -- /system/bin/logcat -L ...

or "auto"? Or "-" like enh suggested. Any of those work for me.

I can't think of anything better.

I wouldn't have more than one choice though. Too many choices will make things confusing.

If we wanted to, we could make this a key/value pair:

exec seclabel=blah uid=blah gid=blah -- 

although that might be overkill too.

Another word choice: "sedefault", which gives a hint this is related to SELinux.
