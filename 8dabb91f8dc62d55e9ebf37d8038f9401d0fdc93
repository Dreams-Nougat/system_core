This is _not_ the way to solve this, because if regex fails and matches more than expected, you will still only get three messages and a statement that the test was successful.

Alas, -m 3 is not a solution, so revert back with the ToDo.

FUD: Without the pclose, however, it could interfere with logcat.maxcount test? Hope not.

One possible easy solution is to push the X lines of content, wait one second to settle (there is roughly a 20ms latency from pushing a log entry, to it showing up in logd, timestamp is accurate, its just delayed delivery) _before_ running logcat. Add the -d flag to logcat and it will close when it has no more content. Easy peasy.

This comment should have been made in the --regex CL, please fix there if the above paragraph solves your problem.

Send a fourth one, we need that in order to test count of 3.

(NB: if any test runs first, e.g. logcat.regex runs first, it has already pushed more than 4 lines; this deals with the case where someone runs logcat_unit_test --gtest_filter=logcat.maxcount)

As pointed out earlier, w/o closure due to a bug (no signal to kill logcat process), this will pause forever. The net result will be go/apct will report a timeout failure (all tests are given 60 seconds to run) and we can investigate, so not that big of a deal. Please put a comment here stating the possibility.

As noted earlier, you can add the -d flag to logcat to solve this problem, but to do so requires a one second sleep between pushing content and starting up logcat.
