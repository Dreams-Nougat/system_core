while you're here, maybe metrics_collector_service?

I wonder why you need unique_ptr here since you are just creating this object in this scope and then immediately destroying it at the end of the function. Looks like local stack allocation would work as well:

  brillo::BinderWatcher binder_watcher;
  CHECK(binder_watcher.Init()) << "Binder FD watcher init failed";

Done.  Should have updated this when it moved to a long-lived scope.

Maybe "Register the service with the system service manager?
