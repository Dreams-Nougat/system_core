ugh. we have a python script to auto-generate a .java file for each set of log tags (build/tools/java-event-log-tags.py), but nothing for native code?

Alas, this header is the wrong place for the list of tags in any case. So far we have been ad-hoc, and in some cases even added them to the associated Android.mk files as a -D define passed in to the compiler.

As a baby-step, add a build-time tool or script to convert SecurityLog.logtag into a local header?

NB: __android_log_security_bswrite() calls a subroutine which checks __android_log_security() in the cases where the LOG-SECURITY buffer is referenced. For this call, we are not saving enough cycles to warrant the pre-check. One would expect the caller to use __android_log_security() if there is some work to be done (eg: calculate a package SHA) to format the message.
