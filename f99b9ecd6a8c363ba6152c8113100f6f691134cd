LOG(DEBUG)? I don't know what we think about moving to the new thing. Iirc I had been using LOG for new code, but perhaps I shouldn't have.

Obviously I have no say in what you guys decide, but here's the problems I've seen with D(): it doesn't give a timestamp which is often useful (I do this in my private builds) and D() only has 1 level, which means that when Siva on the Android Studio team asks people to attach adb.log, it probably does not contain anything useful since normal people do not set ADB_TRACE ahead of time. Maybe LOG() isn't the solution, but that's my $0.02.

Should probably document that we aren't really going to be error checking the address for the caller. We'll catch clearly wrong things like an invalid number of separators, but 'foo:bar:baz' and '...' are valid addresses as far as this is concerned.
