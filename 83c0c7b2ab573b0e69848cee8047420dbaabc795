I see u have already fixed unsigned integer overflow (df9c4a01), 2 things..

- sanitize is good to debug leaks and overflow for many areas like thread, stack, memory, data flow etc..

- Any reason only enabling only integer here (which you have already fixed). You can use "-fsanitize=undefined" for all checks, if you want to get rid of other errors..

Good for debugging at local build but not sure if it should go to integration..
