how much load does this cause? i guess it doesn't affect the emulators much because once we find one, we stay connected and L97 short-circuits that. so it's just the cost of 32 failed network connections each second?

the cpu load of this thread is 0.002 (8ms / 5s). I think it is acceptable. not deserve to do something tricky?

i'm actually more worried about innocent processes that have these ports bound :-)

but, yeah, i think this is fine until proven otherwise.

Linux & Windows adb are already polling for USB devices once a second, which is already bad (something that could be fixed for Windows). Is there some way to avoid this TCP connect attempt once a second? It seems like laptop users might mind the battery impact?

on Linux we could use inotify. i actually tried to switch adb over to libusbhost ages ago because it already uses inotify (https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/108551/), but that caused trouble (that apparently i didn't record, and sadly i can't remember). but, yeah, one day we should switch to inotify (one way or another).

(so if there's a way to do this for Windows, that would be good too.)

it's not obvious how we can do something similar for emulators though. the only thing i could think of (for Unix at least) would be using Unix domain sockets so they're visible in the file system and then we can just use inotify for them too. *but* that means we'd need changes on the emulator side. (plus we'd need to come up with something else for Mac OS and Windows.)
