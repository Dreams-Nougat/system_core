I'm a little nervous about this because http://r.android.com/182080 tried this and apparently caused some breakage.

However I can't seem to replicate the failure, I cleaned my build then ran both `m checkbuild` and `lunch sdk-eng; make -j40 win_sdk` without problem.

Is there any other build I should try?

Small change needed for Mac, recvfrom() behaves differently on TCP sockets. Will put the fix in the next patch set.
