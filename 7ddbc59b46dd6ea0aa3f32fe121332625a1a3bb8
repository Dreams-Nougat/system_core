do you know that the Mac defines these? or do you not need this on the Mac either? (in which case you should lose or fix the comment.)

long term i wonder whether this should be in a separate header file from the stuff below if that's useful for host tools.

hey... you're not just including this for the side-effect of getting TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY are you?
