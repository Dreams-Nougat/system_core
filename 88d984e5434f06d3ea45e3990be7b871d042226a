Is this a change that we want to make?  Allowing config files to import whole directories instead of specifically named files?

Being able to import directories enables the dev workflow that we're aiming for in Brillo.

We're gonna need to have the Android build system emit init.rc files for a bunch of new native services, so we'd rather have one include rather  than make each dev modify init.rc files.

Right, but when do you plan on doing those imports?  'import' right now happens as the file is being parsed, which means if you try to import a file/directory on /system from the init.rc on the ramdisk, that it will fail.

I've proposed creating a command that would dynamically import files based on a trigger, but that did not gain support.  The idea that we settled on is importing a set of files (directories) after file systems are mounted in do_mount_all, see https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/161602/3

Assuming that we do the above, then we shouldn't need to extend import to be able to import entire directories.  Unless we do think there's a good reason to do so.  We should modify the readme.txt for import if we do as well.

Should we add timing information to this function too?

since we time the individual files, it's probably not worth it?

We can use the d_type entry of dirent to do this same check with less overhead.  We use it in vold and other areas of init, so we already are assuming it's implemented.
