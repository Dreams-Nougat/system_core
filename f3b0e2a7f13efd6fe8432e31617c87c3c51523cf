nit: raw ShellProtocol* might be preferable here, doesn't really matter to me I just remembered the C++ primer saying something about this.

(from C++ primer: "In general, if you find yourself wanting to use a pointer or reference to a unique_ptr, you're probably not transferring ownership, so you should usually just pass a pointer or reference to the underlying object, and keep unique_ptr out of it.")

Is it safe to do this in a signal handler? I can't seem to find concrete information in the man pages but the articles/forum posts that I can find indicate this is unsafe.

Would it be feasible to drop the lock and instead only enable SIGWINCH handling after the read thread has been set up?

Why not just set a volatile sig_atomic_t flag here and read it when read() returns EINTR? As well as David's idea.

as an aside: now we're always building for Windows too, i wonder if we should just get rid of these #defines for Unix? (but keep them for Windows.) that way Unix-only code doesn't need to do stuff like this, but we'll still know straight away if we've tried to use bare 'read' in code that runs on Windows.

Makes sense to me, enabling a 3rd read() function is kind of a bummer but it seems necessary, and better than having to mess with macros for a legitimate use case like this.

It's up to you guys. I guess there's two main schools of thought:

- Make read() on Windows work with C Runtime fds and sysdeps fds.
- Split read() into unix_read() which works with C Runtime fds and adb_read() which works with sysdeps fds.

So the proposal is for a 3rd option?

(i'd like to move all this code out into a separate file, but i've been disruptive enough here already.)
