I'd just delete this. It's no longer accurate.

Is there value in knowing what time the process started, vs how long it took to start?

I personally wouldn't find this information useful, especially if the device has a persistent clock which carries over across reboots, or if time is adjusted in the middle of the boot process.

(the first stage can't set properties, so i have to pass this through to the second stage to set.)

fkupolov: when you add the coldboot time to tron, note that this property name changed too.

You should clear the environment variable after you read it, to avoid polluting the environment space + leak information to child processes.

I like the idea of aborting. It would provide slightly more debugging information in the kernel trace, and would effectively have the same effect as rebooting the device.

aborting would reboot, although probably not taking destination into account.  Seems fine though, it shouldn't ever happen, and if it does it will show up in the kernel panic dashboards.
