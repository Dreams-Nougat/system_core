so this was static above, but non-static here. and then in the art change, it seemed like we include libz again as a static library? shouldn't it just be done here as static and then not again in users of this library?

Sorry. That was the intention. I was fiddling around with static vs shared to measure sizes and I must have left this half reverted.

(I was also fiddling around with renaming libz-host -> libz since we don't really need a different name, and it complicates other makefiles but I decided to leave that for a follow up)

we found it a lot clearer to have the -host suffixes, there were issues doing minimal builds sometimes without it. for example, when you require a module in the PRODUCT_PACKAGES, it doesn't know to do only one and not both.
