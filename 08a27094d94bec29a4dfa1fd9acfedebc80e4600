Does it matter that isatty() returns true for NUL on Windows? I couldn't come up with a failing test case other than 'adb shell < nul' which no one in their right mind runs.

isatty() came to my attention because I realized that for Windows, adb has 3 or 4 ways of checking for a console:

* isatty() in unix_read (which I just recommended a few weeks ago).
* isatty()+GetConsoleMode() in _get_console_handle()
* GetFileType()+GetConsoleMode() in stdin_raw_init() (almost the same thing since isatty() is probably implemented by calling GetFileType())
* enh is about to add GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo() in line_printer.cpp

This StackOverflow answer (http://stackoverflow.com/a/3650507) sums up the problem: different API specs for isatty() on Windows vs. *nix.

My thinking is to ignore this issue for now and maybe at some point (if it becomes really necessary) make adb_isatty() for Windows and #define isatty adb_isatty.
