generalize this for the pipe family too?

Can't this just be a `bool socketpair(unique_fd[2])` overload?

this still seems way too low-level. shouldn't the child be a lambda?

(all three of these things seem like they should have their own header files.)

This seems super error prone.

I've gone back-and-forth on this one.  On the one hand you can shoot yourself in the foot by passing in an object that doesn't like being bitwise copied.  On the other hand send()/recv() already let you shoot yourself in the foot by doing exactly that.

I'm fine with removing it, or restricting it to POD types.  I'm mainly interested in the fd-sharing case, where the cmsg API is kind of fiddly and IMO not all that well documented.

Thoughts?

rather than have the operation in the constructor, i think we should expose the fd array so we can use this with the whole family.

I like Josh's idea of just implementing bool socketpair(unique_fd[2]) and pipe(unique_fd[2]), so none of these details are hidden inside a class.

This seems like it would be more useful to have this generally available for any unix domain socket, not just socketpairs created through this class. We have dozens of copies of this boilerplate throughout the codebase.

As in, break this method out into its own helper function, or make local_socketstream work with other kinds of sockets?

If it's the latter, there's already a constructor that just consumes a bare fd.
