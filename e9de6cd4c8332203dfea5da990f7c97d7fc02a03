no point copying obsolete paths into new files (especially in a deprecated style of copyright header) :-)

this is very similar to the existing MIPSAssembler.* files --- are you sure you don't want to share more code?

(especially because this is 4000 lines in total --- more than twice the size of the [equally copy & pasted] ARM and aarch64 ones.)

We can rework this by inheriting classes from MIPSAssembler files and overriding where necessary.

it's up to you; i don't want to hold you to a higher standard than others have been held to. but given how similar mips and mips64 are i thought you might prefer to not maintain two copies.

i thought mips64r2 was dead to you now? simplify these conditions?

I will check on that and make changes where applicable (if indeed MIPS64r6 is the only "living" target)

did you consider using gtest instead? that would make it easier to fit these in to automated testing/reporting.

We didn't consider using gtest, as we mimicked ARM tests. If you prefer, we can rewrite the tests using gtest interface.
