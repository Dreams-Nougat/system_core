This is the only part I'm not sure of, I think this could leak local_socket_sfd_.

Before this change, when WaitForExit() wasn't properly called, our Subprocess object would retain ownership of local_socket_sfd_ and close it during destruction.

But now that WaitForExit() is closed, this code passes local_socket_sfd_ to fdevent_subproc_event_func() and assumes that it will close the FD, which I don't think it will since this FD never got registered with g_poll_node_map (fdevent.cpp:307).

I think we want to close this FD manually if ForkAndExec() failed, and check if it's valid before passing it here.
