OOPS, sorry, one other nit.

Can you please #include "fs_mgr.h" and move this function back to where it originally was. The only reason you had to move the function was because you were missing the declaration of fs_mgr_free_fstab, which is provided by the header file.

This will preserve "git blame" history and make this commit smaller.
