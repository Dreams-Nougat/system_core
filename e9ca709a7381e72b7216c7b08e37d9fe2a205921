In my codebase atomic-inline.h does nothing than including atomic.h. Should we just include atomic.h instead and even remove atomic-inline.h?

from conversations with hboehm i was under the impression that there were lots of users of atomic-inline.h, but i only see three! i'll kill them...

(there are still hundreds of users of atomic.h, sadly. we need to think of a plan to at least make sure new code gets written with <stdatomic.h> instead.)
