Possibly slightly more readable and I think does the same thing:

  if (!android::base::StartsWith(spec, "tcp:"))

No, listening on port 0 has meaning. It means "listen on an available port", which you can get the value of with getsockname.

Connecting on port 0 is meaningless, but AFAIK we handle that properly elsewhere.

What's the value of goto here? If we just make the second block an "else" doesn't that accomplish the same thing?

What does this comment mean? Why we want a "0" port number here?

Now this is somewhat confusing, it seems if hostname=="127.0.0.1", we don't consider it as localhost and will go the else branch...

Yeah, this is a hack, but it only matters for tcp reverse forwarding on the device side (i.e. connect to host and have it forwarded to connect to a port on the device), which is uncommon (and rejected connecting to localhost:1234 entirely).

So what's the purpose for this CL?  just for "adb connect"? But from the test you mentioned, it seems you are expecting it also work with adb server. But from my test (patched your CL):

killall adb

/out/host/linux-x86/bin/adb -L 'tcp:127.0.0.1:5037' devices
List of devices attached
** Cannot start server on remote host
error: cannot connect to daemon at tcp:127.0.0.1:5037: Connection refused

Oops, forgot that tcp_host_is_local is used for that too. That's an orthogonal issue that I'm fixing next.
