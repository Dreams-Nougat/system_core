It seems redundant to have eh_frame in the variable name when the struct is named EhFrame. Applies to all of the variables in this structure.

Should probably just be fde_table_offset.

This isn't true, the last address is stored in the program headers section. The executable PT_LOAD will have the virt address as the start, and the size plus that will give you the end address.

Yes, An end address read from section headers or program headers is better than a guess. I use end of '.text' section as it is more strict than end of PT_LOAD segment. PT_LOAD contains other sections (.ARM.exidx, .rodata, etc) after .text section.

It's not clear why you need this. Couldn't you have some way to modify the has_arm_exidx or other variables from DebugFrameInfo instead?

libbacktrace_test.so on arm is built with both .debug_frame and .ARM.exidx info, both works. I want to test explicit either .debug_frame or .ARM_exidx, or both. So I need to a way to tell BacktraceOffline to only use .debug_frame, or only use .ARM.exidx, or use both.
DebugFrameInfo is not exported outside BacktraceOffline.cpp, and is generated during unwinding (not before unwinding), so modifying DebugFrameInfo before unwinding doesn't work.

Why can't you have a test that has one or the other or both?

The way this is currently working indicates either a deficient test, or a deficient design. I think it's okay to expose some internal of an object to be able to test it, but adding in code specifically called test indicates something is wrong.

instead of using test_option, changed to test with customized libbacktrace_test.so.
