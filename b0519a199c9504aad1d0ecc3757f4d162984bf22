I'd recommend rephrasing this to better explain the problem at hand, i.e. the fact that when the adb command is launched from a Python script, stdout/stderr are both inheritable by default, which creates problem, like the fact that the caller will hang when trying to read the command's output even if the client has completed running.

Apart from that, I don't see a problem with the code.
