I accept the math and am not blocking on it.

Although one would find a 'divide by ten until zero' loop is faster and does not suffer from edge conditions or 1.0 != 1.0 problems.

We are not requiring speed, this is low frequency, so maintenance before optimization.

snprintf 'simplification' works because android is C99 compliant in the libraries, but given my advanced age ;-}, I will always bow to portability rationalizations.
