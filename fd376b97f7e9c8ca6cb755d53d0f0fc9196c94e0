I think you could do this:

  if (__builtin_add_overflow(ts.tv_sec, reltime_sec, &ts.tv_sec)) {
#if defined(__LP64__)
    ts.tv_sec = INT64_MAX;
#else
    ts.tv_sec = INT32_MAX;
#endif
  }

Which would replace the code down below too.

isn't that unavailable in GCC until GCC 5? this code is used by a lot of vendor code, so i'm assuming it's still going to be built with GCC for a while...

maybe in an #if __clang__ so we can remove this in a few years?
