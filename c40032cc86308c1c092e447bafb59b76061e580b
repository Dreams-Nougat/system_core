Yesterday evening was asked if this was lines or bytes.

Need to change this to something like:

uid=1000(system) comm=surfaceflinger too chatty, dropped 182 lines

If we report one line, make it grammatically correct, eg: "...dropped %u line%s", ..., mDropped, (mDropped > 1) ? "s" : "");

NB: single line drops need to be merged aggressively, the 1 second ratelimit adjustment should be extended to do this.
