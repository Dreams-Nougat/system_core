Since this function only ever returns 0, maybe it would be better to have this void, and the call below be:

do_bootchart_stop();
return 0;

As is, it looks like this function could return something other than 0.

may not for this CL, but can we move sampling into its own thread? Then bootchart will have less impact to boot-up process itself>

normally adding threads to init is scary (because none of the init code has any locks), but in this case it might not be too bad --- this file is self-contained enough that we can probably draw a boundary, add one big lock, and call it done.

but does this patch as-is solve your current problem?
