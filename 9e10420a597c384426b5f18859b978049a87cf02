don't copy and paste the documentation: the copy *inside* adb is out of date, so this one is only going to be worse.

good idea, but how about putting the "next step:" on a separate line for easier copy & paste, since that's what they need to do next.

i did think about just automatically running bootchart. should we just do that? we wouldn't even need to copy the .tgz then. realistically, anyone not debugging the init bootchart implementation itself doesn't care about the the .tgz.

funny thing, I had it as two lines, and then joined them at the last second muttering about too noisy.

I also thought about running bootchart, since we both think this way, I am going to gratuitously make it happen!

no need to encourage people to do the wrong thing... they should be using $ANDROID_SERIAL rather than passing -s to every command they run.

I do not believe -s is wrong because I may be pushing/running tests on serveral N10s or N9s at the same time. But point taken, bootchart is usually done on one system for focus'd research.
