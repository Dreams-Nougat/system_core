This toolbox change also looks ok to me, but it is not required from my perspective. I was under the impression that you guys wanted to keep the syntax for the command line tool the same as other existing implementations, i.e. name=value, and that is totally fine by me.

My only concern was the part in init, and that looks fine to me as well.

setsebool in Linux distros accept either syntax,
   setsebool name value
or
  setsebool name=value...
The first form was the original syntax; the second form was added later to support setting multiple booleans at one time.
Of the two forms, the latter was more general so I used it for init and toolbox originally.
But with the change to the init syntax I thought we should keep toolbox consistent.
