exec is run blocking/single-threaded inline

If this was defined as a onetime service (eg: logd-reinit for example) and triggered with start here, then it proceeds in the background with no boot delays.

_must_ this check be done as an exec here, or can it tolerate a race-condition<<<<<<<<<<<<<<delay?

It can probably survive some slop. Providing it has done its work before anything that uses the data tries to use it then it's probably ok.

Things that might try to use it are anything built using bionic and use functions like localtime / mktime.

Later on, ART-based executables that use ICU4J or libcore (e.g. the zygote and or app_process things like package manager) are also users of the timezone data. It would probably be bad if the data being deleted disappeared during launch, but it's ok after because all the users should copy with an unlink (and just keep using the old data).

I thought exec was defined as a wrapper around a onetime service? Or is the idea that we'd give it the same class as several other things and so all the things in that class would be started at once?

he wants to make sure that the right tzdata is in place before anything starts running. his dependency on logd means he's guaranteeing that it'll take two reboots before logd sees the new tzdata. but i don't think logd uses tzdata so it shouldn't matter. (but this is another example of why i don't think this is the best solution in the long term. it just happens to be a major leap forward from where we are, and much more achievable.)

"I thought exec was defined as a wrapper around a onetime service?"

it is. but...

"exec is run blocking"

is also true. otherwise you'd just use a oneshot service :-) the point of exec is that it says "i want you to do this now, and i need to know it's been done before i continue".

this would make sense if you actually _used_ the different values. but you just LOG "something went wrong" at the call sites, and this method already logs the exact failure (which i think is the better approach anyway).

so just switch to bool?
