Do we need to include <cutils/threads.h> where gettid is used for this to work properly? I would expect to get some kind of warning using a function that wasn't defined, but maybe there are no warnings.

I think it's already picking up that header. From the -E output I see

...

# 1 "system/core/libbacktrace/thread_utils.h" 1

extern pid_t gettid();
